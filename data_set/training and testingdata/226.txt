Eight Members of the United National Party who were also members of Parliament
singly filed eight petitions bearing numbers SC 4 - 11/91 challenging their
expulsion from the Party. The respective petitioners in applications No. SC
5/91 and No. SC 8/91 were Ministers of Cabinet rank in the UNP government
shortly before their expulsion.

The petitioner in application No. SC 9/91 and the petitioner in application
No. SC 10/91 were a State Minister and Project Minister respectively in the
UNP government shortly before their expulsion. The petitioners have filed
their respective applications under and in terms of Article 99 (13) (a) of the
Constitution. The expulsion of these eight members of the United National
Party if held to be valid will result in their being deprived of their seats
in Parliament.

The eight applications were heard together. The eight petitioners were alleged
to have participated in steps being taken in late August 1991 under Article 38
(1) (e) read with Article 38 (2) for the removal of the President who was also
the leader of the United National Party. Notice of a resolution in terms of
Article 38 (2) (a) signed by more than the half the whole number of members of
Parliament was stated to have been handed in to the Speaker who on 28

136

August 1991 informed the President in writing declaring that he had
entertained the said resolution in terms of Article 38 (2) (b) and drawing
attention to proviso (c) to Article 70 (1). On 08 October 1991 however the
Speaker announced in Parliament that having inquired into the matter he was of
the view that the notice of resolution did not have the required number of
valid signatures and accordingly could not be proceeded with.

The Speakers letter of 28 August 1991 was received by the President when a
Cabinet Meeting at which the petitioners in SC 5/91 and SC 8/91 were present,
was in progress. A vote of confidence in the President was called for and
those present including the petitioners in SC 5/91 and SC 8/91 unanimously
expressed their support for the President by a show of hands. However, it
later became known that they supported the notice and they resigned from the
Cabinet on 30 August 1991.

On 30 August 1991 the President prorogued Parliament until 24 September 1991.

The resolution in question alleged-that the President was guilty of
intentional violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, misconduct or
corruption including the abuse of the powers of his office, offences involving
moral turpitude, permanent incapacity to discharge the functions of his office
by reason of mental or physicial infirmity, undermining the powers of
Parliament and of Cabinet Ministers, giving direct orders to Secretaries by-
passing their Ministers, engaging Secretaries to obtain confidential reports
on their Ministers, endangering the security of the State by arming the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), sending off the Indian Peace Keeping
Force (IPKF) without considering military aspects, resorting to unlawful
telephone tapping (including telephones of Ministers), engaging in wasteful
expenditure, including Gam Udawa Celebrations and establishing a one man
dictatorship.

Between 30 August 1991 and 06 September 1991 the petitioners launched a public
campaign reiterating the principal allegations contained in the notice of
resolution as well as other criticisms of the President and appealing for the
abolition of the Executive Presidential system and the restoration of
Parliamentary Democracy making the Executive directly responsible to
Parliament. This campaign also revealed that opposition members had been
associated with the petitioner in regard to the notice of resolution and that
the petitioners desired the widest possible publicity for their views. It was
claimed that 47 members of the UNP had signed the notice of resolution.

On 03 September 1991, 116 members of the Government Parliamentary Group
presented to the Speaker a writing dated 30 August 1991 stating that they do
not support the resolution and those of them who had signed it were
withdrawing their signatures and consent and they claimed that they had signed
through mistake or because of misrepresentation.

137

On 05 September 1991 the petitioners anticipating disciplinary action by the
Parry for expulsion instituted actions in the District Court of Colombo for
declarations and injunctions against steps being taken for their expulsion. On
06 September 1991 they were refused relief. Before they could go to the Court
of appeal, the Disciplinary Committee of the Party met the same evening and
recommended expulsion. A meeting of the working Committee followed immediately
thereafter, and a resolution for the expulsion of all eight petitioners was
passed. On 07 September 1991 the 2500 strong National Executive Committee
(NEC) unanimously endorsed that decision. By letters dated 09 September 1991
the petitioners were informed that they were expelled from the party with
effect from 06 September 1991 by a decision of the Working Committee. No
reference was made to NEC's endorsement.

The petitioners continued their public campaign through meetings and rallies
countrywide, press conferences and publicity in the media

The petitioners filed the present applications and their principal challenge
was on the following grounds

(a) Absence of jurisdiction in the Working Committee.

(b) Inconsistency with the provisions of the Constitution and Statute Law.

(c) Breach of the rules of natural justice particularly the audi alteram
partem rule.

(d) Bias and mala fides.

**Held** :

The resolution of the NEC (passed on 19 April 1991) by using the phrase ' full
powers to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the National
Executive Council ' manifests an intention to delegate all powers, duties and
functions including the responsibility and the function in relation to
disciplinary matters.

The Party Constitution does not treat the Working Committee as a subordinate
body to be entrusted only with routine matters of daily administration. Rule 8
(3) (m) of the U.N.P. Constitution expressly empowered the National Executive
Committee (NEC) to vest all or any of its powers and duties whether expressly
enumerated or not on the Working Committee. The delegation in question does
not purport to be permanent or irrevocable, and thus there is no denudation of
its powers by the Executive Committee. Its size the difficulty of having
frequent meetings, and the complexity of the decision - making process in a
large body are matters which the Executive Committee could legitimately have
taken into account in delegating its powers to a smaller Working Committee
selected from among its own members. The Executive Committee was authorised to
and did validly vest in or delegate to the Working Committee its disciplinary
powers under Rule 8 (3) (m). The Working Committee had jurisdiction to take
disciplinary action against the petitioners.

138

Our Constitution confers primacy to the political party as against the
individual M.P. The party carries the mandate of the electors and in turn
gives a mandate to the M.P. The exercise of the rights of the petitioners qua
MP's is subordinate to the requirements of party discipline and their freedom
to agitate matters in public is constrained by reason of their obligations to
the party which they have freely undertaken to honour. Issues in regard to
leadership and the system of government are matters of prime importance to the
party and dissenting views should have been the subject of internal discussion
before being ventilated outside party circles. The internal discussion
procedure was mandatory even if the internal decision might not be binding. A
member is not reduced to the position of a mere cog in the party machine. Some
of his constitutional functions are essentially discretionary and quasi -
judicial, some even judicial. Thus article 4 (c) enables Parliament to
exercise the judicial power of the people in regard to parliamentary
;privilege.

Any member of Parliament was entitled to sign the notice of resolution in the
exercise of his independent judgment and discretion. Signing a notice intended
to be presented, and in fact presented to Parliament in respect of a matter
within its province is a proceeding in Parliament. Freedom of speech (and
thought, conscience and expression) clearly embraces the people's right to
know, the wide dissemination of information and opinions, the public
discussion of all matters of public concern and criticism, however strongly
worded, and even if foolish and without moderation, of public measures and
government action, all this, of course, by peaceful means and without
incitement to violence. However this does not entitle the petitioners to
relief because they are also charged with the failure to raise these matters
internally.

**Per Fernando, J.**

" The rules of a Political Party are not a mere matter of contract but the
basis of the exercise of the freedom of association recognised by Article 14
(1) (c).

One of the conditions on which party members agreed to exercise this
fundamental right was by mutually accepting reciprocal obligations placing
limitations on the exercise of the freedom of speech by each other, in the
interests of their association ".

The ground of expulsion is the signing of the resolution without first raising
it within the party organisation or the government Parliamentary Group.

As the petitioner in S.C. (Special) 5/91 and the petitioner in S.C. (Special)
8/91 lied and deceived the cabinet and have offered no explanation in their
affidavit and none is found in the documents their misconduct was grave and
expulsion was intrinsically a proper penalty. Expulsion of these two
petitioners was valid.

The allegations against the District Judge of Colombo should be expunged.

Held further (Fernando, J. dissenting).

139

The conduct of the petitioners including senior Parliamentarians in disclosing
in public the serious allegations contained in the resolution cannot be
construed as bona fide, and gives credence to the allegation that they used
the resolution as a cover to cause insult and injury to the character,
integrity and ability of the leader of the party in his capacity as President
of the country. Such contumacious conduct constitutes indiscipline in the
party unrelated to the exercise of constitutional rights.

The petitioner's rights were not materially affected by the order of
expulsion. All the issues here relate to legal matters arising upon admitted
facts. The subsequent hearing in the Supreme Court is in substance the right
to an antecedent hearing. No injustice was caused to the petitioners by their
being deprived of an opportunity to give an explanation before the Working
Committee. The expulsions had not yet taken effect and their validity is to be
decided by the Court. There has been no violation of the rules of natural
justice.

The allegations of bias and mala fides have not been substantiated.

The expulsions of the petitioners in cases S.C. (Special) 4/91, 6/91, 7/91,
9/91, 10/91 and 11/91 were also valid and justified.

December 03, 1991.  
**FERNANDO, J.**

Eight Members of Parliament applied to this Court, by petitions in terms of
Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution, challenging their expulsion from the
United National Party (" the Party "), a recognized political party. The
questions of fact and law involved are, except in one respect, identical, and
the parties agreed that all eight petitions be heard and determined together.
It was further agreed that the facts were not seriously in dispute, and that
any contested question of fact should be determined on the basis of the
several affidavits filed, without the need for oral evidence or cross
examination of deponents.

**1\. THE FACTS**

In late August 1991 a sudden crisis occurred in the Party, when it became
known that notice had been given of a resolution in terms of Article 38 (2)
(a) of the Constitution by more than one-half of the whole number of Members
of Parliament. The petitioners have produced a copy of this notice ; it is
undated, does not contain the names, signatures or initials of the
signatories, and is not authenticated in any way ; the Respondents have not
denied that it is indeed a copy of the notice, and so I accept it as a correct
copy. The requisite number of signatures could not have been obtained unless
Party Members also were included. The eight Petitioners admittedly signed this
notice ; when, we have not been told. It is said that forty Party Members
signed, but subsequently (after 28.8.91) some claimed that they had not
signed, or had signed through mistake or misrepresentation, and others
withdrew or revoked their signatures. However, it is unnecessary for me to
decide any of these intriguing questions as to the number of signatories, the
validity of the signatures and of the notice itself, and the entertainment of
the notice by the Speaker. It is clear that this notice was the result of a
secret campaign for some time prior to August 1991 by Opposition Members of
Parliament, the Petitioners, and some other Government Members. It is also
admitted that although the notice refers to serious criticisms of the
President's conduct from the inception of his period of office, at no stage
had the Petitioners expressed any criticism or dissent whatsoever, either
publicly or within the inner councils of the Party. Likewise, they had
expressed no criticism or reservation regarding the Executive Presidential
system embodied in the 1978 Constitution, with a view to its abolition or
reform or otherwise, except that, according to a newspaper report produced by
the Respondents, Mr. Gamini Dissanayake (the Petitioner in S.C. 4/91) stated
(in September 1991) that in 1989, at a joint meeting of trade unions, he had
advocated the abolition of the Executive Presidential system for the solution
of the problems of the country, and that the President was aware of this. The
notice was delivered to. the Speaker on 27.8.91, or perhaps shortly before. By
a letter dated 28.8.91 the Speaker informed the President that he had
entertained a resolution complying with Article 38 (2) (a) and (b). Neither
this letter nor a copy has been produced, but another document reproduces its
contents, as to which there is thus now no dispute. It. would seem that this
letter was originally dated 27.8.91, and then altered to 28.8.91. A copy of
the

144

notice itself was not sent to the President. The Speaker's letter was received
by the President whilst a Cabinet meeting was in progress; two Petitioners
(Messrs G. M. Premachandra and Lalith Athulathmudali) being then Cabinet
Ministers, were present. A vote of confidence in the President was called for,
and those present, including those two Petitioners, unanimously expressed
their support for the President by a show of hands. However, it later became
known that they supported the notice, and they resigned from the Cabinet on
30.8.91.

According to a newspaper report on 31.8.91 of a Press Conference held on
30.8.91, at which Messrs Premachandra and Athulathmudali were present,

" Asked how it was possible for Messrs Athulathmudali and Premachandra to
subscribe to the unanimous expressing of confidence in President Premadasa at
last Wednesday's cabinet meeting, Mr. Athulathmudali said the motion had been
signed after the cabinet meeting. "

Another newspaper account of a farewell speech by Mr. Athulathmudali to his
Ministry staff a day or two later, quotes him as having said that he did not
sign the notice while he was in the Cabinet, but only after resigning.
According to yet another report,

" Mr. Athulathmudali said that at the Cabinet meeting there was a show of
hands. This happened subsequently, he said and added 'there is no
inconsistency between raising your hand and then offering to resign'."

These reports have not been contradicted. On being asked whether Mr.
Athulathmudali signed the notice before or after the vote of confidence,
learned President's Counsel, after speaking to him, stated to us that he had
no dear instructions on this point.

On 30.8.91 the President (who was precluded by Article 70 (1) (c) from
dissolving Parliament " after the Speaker has entertained a resolution
complying with ' Article 38 (2) (a) and (b)) prorogued Parliament until
24.9.91.

145

Between 30.8.91 and 6.9.91 the Petitioners commenced a public campaign,
reiterating the principal allegations contained in the notice of resolution,
as well as other criticisms of the President and appealing for the abolition
(and not merely the reform) of the Executive Presidential system and the
restoration of Parliamentary Democracy making the Executive directly
responsible to Parliament. This campaign also revealed that Opposition Members
had been associated with the Petitioners in regard to the notice of
resolution, and that the Petitioners desired the widest possible publicity for
their views.

On 5.9.91, the Petitioners, anticipating disciplinary action by the Party for
expulsion, instituted actions in the District Court of Colombo for
declarations and injunctions ; on 6.9.91 they were refused relief. Before they
could go to the Court of Appeal, the Disciplinary Committee of the Party met
the same evening, and recommended expulsion; a meeting of the Working
Committee followed immediately thereafter, and a resolution for the expulsion
of all eight Petitioners was passed. That resolution recited that the
President is ex officio the Leader of the Parry ; that the eight Petitioners
were bound by the Party Constitution and had been elected to Parliament on the
Party list ; that in the District Court proceedings they had admitted signing
the notice of resolution for the removal of the President ; and then set out
the grounds of expulsion thus:

AND WHEREAS the signing. of the aforesaid Resolution, together with several
Members of the Opposition in Parliament, is an act of betrayal of the Party
membership and the confidence placed by the people in the Party and its
leadership at successive elections,

AND WHEREAS after the Hon. Speaker had informed the President he had
entertained the said Notice of Resolution under Article 38(2), Messrs G. M.
Premachandra and Lalith Athulathmudali had in addition deliberately misled and
deceived the Cabinet of Ministers on the 28th of August, 1991, into believing
that they were ignorant of and were not associated with the notice of the
Resolution, by joining the rest of the Members of the Cabinet in passing an
unanimous Vote of Confidence in the President by a show of hands individually,

146

AND WHEREAS the aforesaid eight members have signed the said Notice of
Resolution without any prior intimation to the Party or raising or discussing
the same within the Party organization or the Government Parliamentary Group,

AND WHEREAS the said eight members had at the General Election of February
1989 sought and obtained nomination on the Lists of the United National Party
and the voters had elected them to Parliament on the basis and understanding
that they are members and candidates of the United National Party who accept
the Leadership of the Party and the Executive Presidential system of
Government, and are therefore bound to adhere to the Party Manifesto and Party
Constitution and policies whilst being representatives of the Party in
Parliament,

AND WHEREAS it has been and continues to be the principle and policy of the
United National Party that the Government of the country should consist of an
Executive President elected by the people and an elected Parliament,

AND WHEREAS the aforesaid members have since the giving of the said Notice of
Resolution to the Speaker repeatedly announced in public that they are against
the elected Executive Presidential system, and have also used this as a cover
to cause insult and injury to the character, integrity and ability of the
Leader of the Party in his capacity as President of the country,

AND WHEREAS the aforesaid acts have all been done by the said eight members
without first raising the said issues within the Party organization or the
Government Parliamentary Group as is required by the Party Constitution and
conventions,

AND WHEREAS the Disciplinary Committee has on the basis of the aforesaid
recommended to the Working Committee of the Party that disciplinary action be
taken against the said eight members for their flagrant conduct in violating
the Constitution, conventions, policies and procedures of the Party,

AND WHEREAS the Working Committee having considered the aforesaid conduct and
actions of the said eight members and the recommendation of the Disciplinary
Committee has come to the

147

conclusion that these members have manifestly and flagrantly and in disregard
of Party discipline, duties and responsibilities, breached the conditions of
membership of the Party, acted contrary to the principles and policies of the
Party, repudiated and violated the Constitution and conventions of the Party,
and brought the Party and its leadership into disrepute and held it up to
public ridicule.

The Working Committee accordingly resolves that the aforesaid eight members be
expelled from the membership of the United National Party with effect from 6th
September, 1991.

The Working Committee further resolves that the General Secretary of the Party
notifies the Secretary General of Parliament and the Commissioner of Elections
of the expulsion of the aforesaid eight members.

On 7.9.91, the National Executive Committee unanimously " endorsed " that
decision. All this was without any notice whatever to the Petitioners. By
letters dated 9.9.91 each of the Petitioners was informed that he had been
expelled from membership of the Party, with effect from 6.9.91, by a decision
of the Working Committee ; no reference was made to the National Executive
Committee's " endorsement " of that decision ; a copy of the expulsion
resolution was also sent.

Thereafter the Petitioners continued their public campaign. Although it has
been submitted that the Petitioners were only seeking the reform of certain
anomalies in the Executive Presidential system, the material before us
establishes that, throughout, the issue presented to the public was "
Executive Presidency versus Parliamentary Democracy." Parliament met on
24.9.91 ; on 8.10.91 the Speaker announced to Parliament that, having inquired
into the matter, he was of the view that the notice of resolution did not have
the required number of valid signatures and hence could not be proceeded with.
On 4.10.91 these petitions were filed.

148

**2\. ALLEGATION OF BIAS AGAINST DISTRICT JUDGE**

The petition in each case, makes reference to the unsuccessful actions filed
in the District Court of Colombo on 5.9.91. Paragraph 21 of the petition, and
paragraph 22 of the affidavit (in S.C. (Special) No. 4/91), filed in this
Court, refer to a speech made by the District Judge of Colombo, as President
of the Judicial Service Association, at the Annual Conference of the
Association, welcoming the President. In the course of that speech, the
District Judge conveyed the appreciation of the members of the minor judiciary
of the practice of promoting senior judges of the minor judiciary to the High
Court, and of steps taken in relation to the welfare and conditions of service
of the members of the minor judiciary, making special mention of housing
schemes and cars. Such action, he said, was in recognition of the fact that
the judiciary is a vital and integral part of the state, especially in
maintaining peace and order. These issues were in no sense personal to the
District Judge himself, but related to matters of legitimate interest and
concern to all members of the Association. It was a formal and open expression
of gratitude for the provision of facilities which did not unduly favour the
minor judiciary, but which enabled at least the majority of them to enjoy
facilities comparable to public officers. He assumed that judicial officers
may, like Oliver Twist, ask for more and may give thanks for what they get.

However each Petitioner proceeded to allege that he " has reason to believe in
all the circumstances that justice was not seen to be done in his case "; this
was re-iterated in counter-affidavits dated 26.10.91. Learned President's
Counsel concluded his submissions on behalf of the Petitioner on 4.11.91
without in any way relying on this allegation to support the prayer for relief
under Article 99 (13) (a).

These applications are not by way of appeal from, or review or re-
consideration of, the proceedings or order in the District Court. The
insinuation of partiality is in no way relevant to the issues of fact and law
arising in these applications. We are therefore not called upon in any way to
determine whether that allegation was justified, or even whether there was a
reasonable suspicion of bias requiring the District Judge to disqualify
himself. Indeed, if we were to consider whether there was substance in that
allegation, we would be doing so in proceedings to which the District Judge is
not, and could not have been, a respondent, and we would thereby be denying to
him

149

what the Petitioners claim for themselves, namely the protection of the audi
alteram partem rule.

In these circumstances we indicated to learned President's Counsel on 4.11.91
that the pleadings filed in this Court should not have contained such an
obviously irrelevant allegation of bias, and one based on such tenuous grounds
; that this Court could not ignore the aspersions cast on a judicial officer,
of an inferior court but nevertheless an integral part of the judiciary of Sri
Lanka ; and that in the circumstances it seemed right that allegation should
no longer be permitted to remain on the record. Learned President's Counsel
wished to have time for consideration. On 13.11.91, at the conclusion of his
submissions in reply, he informed us that the Petitioners, while re-affirming
that they suffer a deep sense of grievance that they were denied justice when
they sought relief in the District Court, nevertheless recognised the force of
our observations that no finding was possible on that allegation, and while
reserving their right to take up the matter elsewhere, desired to withdraw the
offending averments.

These proceedings involve important questions of law as to the status, rights
and powers of the Executive President, vis-a-vis Parliament and Members of
Parliament, and the Petitioners seek to vindicate the rights and privileges of
Parliament and its Members. When the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked for
such purposes, it is more than ordinarily important that nothing should be
done unfairly to impair the independence, and the reputation, of the judiciary
or any section of it. Unsuccessful litigants may labour under a sense of
grievance, in respect of orders which are either wrong or believed to be wrong
; they have the right to avail themselves of all such remedies as the law
allows, but they are not at liberty to use judicial proceedings recklessly to
scatter allegations of partiality. Neither the Petitioners nor their legal
advisers should have permitted this base allegation to be made, and persisted
in. It does not redound to the credit of those professing to enhance
democratic institutions and practices in Sri Lanka, that there was not even a
perfunctory expression of regret for the injury to the judiciary and the
officer concerned. However, as the allegation was made in restrained terms, in
this instance we merely direct the Registrar, to expunge the offending
passages from the record, namely

150

(a) the entirety of paragraph 21 of the petition dated 4.10.91, and paragraph
22 of the supporting affidavit, in S.C. (Special) No 4/91 ; and

(b) the last sentence of paragraph 9 of the counter-affidavit dated 26.10.91,

as well as the corresponding passages in the other seven cases.

**3\. THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE PETITIONERS**

Learned President's Counsel for the 1st to 4th Respondents submitted that the
Petitioners were expelled not for signing the notice of resolution, or for
advocating the abolition of the Executive Presidential system, but for their
failure to give prior intimation to the proper Party organisations (such as
the Executive Committee, the Working Committee and the Government
Parliamentary Group). Further, after signing that notice, they had used their
campaign against the Executive Presidential system as a cover to cause insult
and injury to the character, integrity and ability of the Leader of the Party
in his capacity as President. In addition, Messrs Premachandra and
Athulathmudali had deceived the Cabinet on 28.8.91.

The Petitioners, however, construe the expulsion resolution differently, and
say it contains five distinct charges:

1\. In regard to the notice of resolution

(a) That the act of signing, together with Opposition Members, constituted a
bertrayal of the Party ; both the membership and the leadership ;

(b) That Messrs Premachandra and Athulathmudali had deceived the Cabinet into
believing that they were not associated with the resolution ; and

(c) That the notice had been signed without prior intimation or discussion
within the Party organisations.

151

2\. In regard to the Executive Presidential system

(a) That having obtained Party nomination, and having been elected on the
basis of their acceptance of the Party Leadership and the Executive
Presidential system, and being bound by the Party Constitution, manifesto,
principles and policies (one principle and policy being that government should
be by an Executive President elected by the people and an elected Parliament),
they had repeatedly announced in public their opposition to this Executive
Presidential system, without first raising the said issues within the Party
organisations or the Government Parliamentary Group ; and

(b) That they had used this as a cover to cause insult and injury to the
character, integrity and ability of the leader of the Party in his capacity as
President.

Learned President's Counsel for the Respondents sought to persuade us that the
gravamen of the charge was the lack of prior intimation and internal
discussion - which might have transformed the winter of their discontent into
glorious summer of Party unity. This was principally on the basis that the
eighth and ninth recitals in the expulsion resolution set out the
recommendation of the Disciplinary Committee and the decision of the Working
Committee ; that the seventh recital contains the operative charge ; namely
the failure to raise those issues internally ; and that the first six recitals
merely state other ingredients (alternative or cumulative) relevent to that
charge. Since the seventh recital refers to " all " the aforesaid acts there
is some justification for regarding it as referring to all the preceding
recitals ; not being a charge in a criminal proceeding, a high degree of
precision is not expected. However such a construction results in some
anomalies. That recital is not relevant at all to the second recital ; it is
unnecessarily repetitive of the third recital ; it is quite inappropriate to
the allegation of causing insult and injury. Further, the first recital is an
independent charge, complete in itself: that signing the notice, together with
Opposition Members, was an act of betrayal. The seventh recital could
therefore be more appropriately read as applicable only to' the sixth, though
not to the allegation of causing insult and injury.; or perhaps even as only
an aggravating element. Before deciding which of these competing

152

 interpretations is correct, it is relevant to see how the parties understood
that resolution. The Petitioners averred in their petitions that they could
not legally be expelled on the ground that they signed the notice of
resolution, setting out several independent contentions; that the act of
signing was not a violation of the Party Constitution, conventions, policies,
principles or discipline ; that Party rules cannot override the Constitution ;
that they had a Constitutional right and power to sign the notice ; that the
act of signing was not liable to be questioned by virtue of Parliamentary
privilege ; and that the act of signing was in the exercise of the fundamental
rights of freedom of thought, conscience and speech. They said nothing about
their failure to raise the matter internally ; perhaps they had nothing to say
in exculpation, but possibly they did not consider that to be the essence of
the charges. It is of some relevance that when these petitions were called on
24.10.91 to determine certain procedural questions, one of the matters in
issue was formulated as " whether the signing of the [notice of] resolution
under Article 38 (2) constitutes a ground for expulsion ", and the lack of
prior internal discussion was not mentioned.

The Respondents replied thus in each case

"31\. ...........if the Petitioner had any complaint or allegations against
the Leader of the Party or desired to advocate any change in the policy of the
Party regarding the Executive Presidential system, he was obliged and bound to
first raise the same within the Organisation of the Party and abide by the
decision of the Party in regard thereto. The Petitioner at no stage raised
within the Party or at any meeting of the Government Parliamentary Group......
any complaint against the Leader of the Party or against the Party's policy of
an Executive Presidential System.' '

32\. (a) The Petitioner nevertheless was a signatory to a Notice of Resolution
under Article 38 (2) ............. for the removal of the Party Leader from
the Office of President of Sri Lanka. The said Notice of Resolution contained
serious allegations of a grave nature ............. It also alleged mental
infirmity against the Leader of the Party:

153

(b) Subscription to the said Notice of Resolution containing the said
allegations by a member of the Party and of the Government Party Group carries
with it by necessary implication that the President is a person unfit to be
the Leader of the United National Party."

"33\. The Petitioner had signed the said Notice of Resolution together with
inter alia several Members of the Opposition in. Parliament."

"34.(a) ............the admitted signing of the said Notice of Resolution by
the Petitioner was an act of betrayal of the Party Leadership and membership
and was a violation of the Parry Constitution and Party responsibility and
discipline, justifying the expulsion of the Petitioner from the Party.

(b) .......... the Petitioner had no right to subscribe to such a Notice of
Resolution independently of his obligations as a Member of the Party and of
the Government Parliamentary Group.

(c) In any event, the Petitioner was in violation of the Party Constitution,
discipline and responsibility in doing so without first raising the matter
within the Party or the Government Parliamentary Group."

These averments appear to place the act of signing the notice in the forefront
of the case against the Petitioners ; the failure to raise the matter
internally was - as indicated by the words " in any event " \- an additional,
and subsidiary, charge. This impression is reinforced by the Respondents'
explanation for not taking similar action against other Party Members who
signed the notice:

"24\. (a) ......... all remaining 116 members of the Government Parliamentary
Group signed documents dated 30th August 1991 and 2nd September 1991
disassociating them selves with the Notice of Resolution under Article 38 (2)
of the Constitution and expressing their opposition to such Resolution. These
documents were presented in person by the said 116 members to the Honourable

154

Speaker on 3rd September 1991. Accordingly no disciplinary action was taken
against any other member who may have signed the said Notice of Resolution. At
the meeting of the Working Committee held on 15th October 1991 the Committee
required the Disciplinary Committee to consider and make recommendations in
regard to disciplinary action if any against three members of the Government
Parliamentary Group who have recently associated themselves in the political
activities of the Petitioner and the other seven members."

The stress is on disciplinary action for " signing "; not on the absence of
prior internal discussion. These objections were filed on 23.10.91. The
Petitioners were required to file their counter-affidavits by 28.10.91, after
giving notice to the Respondents by 27.10.91. While denying paragraphs 24 (a),
and 31 to 34, they averred that the Party was not irrevocably committed to the
Executive Presidential system, and that " this question was not raised
[internally] for the reason that there did not exist a degree of freedom
necessary to raise questions which would involve a curtailment of Presidential
power "; this they did not elaborate.

It is thus likely that there was some confusion in the minds of members of the
Working Committee. The minutes of the Working Committee show that the 2nd
Respondent, as General Secretary, made a fair and comprehensive report in
respect of the proceedings and recommendations of the Disciplinary Committee ;
with, however, that same element of uncertainty. He referred succinctly to the
District Court proceedings and order, the Petitioners' admissions in regard to
signing, and the very serious nature of the accusations in the notice ; to the
Petitioners' lawyers' assertion that Members of Parliament had a
Constitutional right to sign such a resolution ; to two Petitioners having
misled the Cabinet; and to the public campaign against the Presidential
system. The minutes record that " he further stated " that the Petitioners had
not previously raised these matters internally ; he then stressed that this
was a breach of discipline. It was not indicated that signing the notice was
not a distinct charge. The findings or views of the Disciplinary Committee are
also not specific on this point ; but it " was of the view that no inquiry was
necessary because the fact of signing of the impeachment Resolution was
admitted." The President " stated that inasmuch as the Notice

155

of Resolution...... was directed against him, he did not wish to participate
in this discussion " ; earlier he had not taken part in the discussion and
recommendations of the Disciplinary Committee " in view of the Impeachment
Resolution."

Learned President's Counsel for the Respondents was himself a member of the
Working Committee and participated in the proceedings of 6.9.91. On that day
too his view must have been that the gravamen of the charge was the lack of
prior internal discussions. That opinion may have been shared by others. But
that position did not clearly emerge in the Respondents' objections and the
2nd Respondent's supporting counter-affidavit.

It is therefore reasonable to infer that the 2nd respondent as well as other
members of both Committees did think that one of the main charges was the act
of signing the notice. Had attention being focussed on this matter, it might
have been determined, after discussion, that the issue was not the fact of
signing. But that did not happen. It appears to me that the better view of the
expulsion resolution is that one of the grounds for expulsion was the fact of
signing. That gives rise to serious questions. Could some members have taken
the view that the resolution contained very serious accusations, and that a
Party member who signed it was guilty of serious misconduct, warranting
expulsion ? If so, could they have properly formed such a view where the text
of the notice was not available ? Had those members been told that was not the
charge, and that the real allegation was the failure to resort to internal
procedures, would they have considered it appropriate to impose a lesser
punishment - such as a brief suspension to be reviewed after the resolution
was taken up in Parliament ? This means however that one does not really know
whether the Petitioners were expelled for signing the resolution, or for the
procedural lapse. Upon consideration of the resolution and the pleadings,
however, I am compelled to treat the expulsion as involving five distinct
charges.

**4\. CAN THE WORKING COMMITTEE EXPEL A MEMBER ?**

Rule 8 of the Party Constitution establishes a National Executive Committee
consisting of ex officio members (such as Members of Parliament) and members
elected by the (annual) Party Convention ; It presently has over 2,500
members. It is required to

156

meet at least once in every six months. It is " the administrative authority
of the Party, subject to the directions and control of the Party Convention,
and its decisions shall be final, subject to review by the Party Convention."
Rule 8 (3) provides that " its duties shall include the following." Having
enumerated various duties, such as conferring with the Parliamentary Party,
convening Party conventions, proposing amendments to the Party Constitution,
organising election funds, adjudicating on disputes between Party
organisations, appointing Nomination Boards and sub-Committees for elections,
and appointing an auditor and certain officers, Rule 8 (3) sets out three
matters relevant for present purposes -

(a) To enforce the Constitution, Standing Orders and Rules, and the Code of
Conduct of the Party, and to take any action it deems necessary for purpose,
whether by way of disaffiliation or cancellation of an organisation or
expulsion or suspension of any individual member or office bearer from office
or otherwise. The National Executive Committee shall have power to take
disciplinary action against any member, Balamandalaya, Organisation or
Association in a manner suitable in the circumstances of each case and mete
out any punishment thereof [sic]. Any such action shall be reported to the
next Annual Convention of the Party.

(b) To see that all its officers and members conform to the Constitution and
Standing Orders of the Party.

(c) Leader of the Party shall appoint a Working Committee from the National
Executive Committee consisting of himself, Deputy Leader and all other office
bearers and any other members not exceeding fifty (50). The Working Committee
shall have the authority to exercise the powers and functions vested in it by
the National Executive Committee."

The last of these is in no sense a "duty" of the Executive Committee, but is
an independent provision.

There can be no dispute that the Executive Committee has the "duty" to enforce
the Party Constitution and relevant rules, and the "duty" as well as the
"power" to take disciplinary action against members, including expulsion,
suspension and other punishments.

157

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner contends that the disciplinary
jurisdiction of the Executive Committee cannot be exercised by the Working
Committee, for several reasons

1\. The Executive Committee is a large, elected body, representative of
various sections of the Party ; the Working Committee is a small body,
appointed by the Leader of the Party from among the members of the Executive
Committee, and therefore not truly representative of the Party. The plenary
power of Administration was vested in the Executive Committee, including
punitive powers of expulsion. The Rules as a whole do not manifest an
intention that these powers may be transferred or delegated to any other body.

2.  Rule 8 (3) (m) appears to authorise the Executive Committee to " vest " powers and functions in the Working Committee. It makes no mention of the procedure to be followed in regard to such " vesting." However, " vesting " more than " delegation ", and amounts to an abdication, renunciation divesting of a power by the Executive Committee ; if such a " vesting " does occur there will be a Constitutional change in that a power previously vested in the Executive Committee will thereafter be vested in the Working Committee. Accordingly, such a " vesting " can only be effected by means of a Constitutional amendment ; not by a mere resolution of the Executive Committee. 

3.  In any event, even if Rule 8 (3) (m) permits some " vesting " of powers by resolution, this would not extend to any of the powers and duties expressly enumerated in Rule 8 (3), but only to incidental matters and routine matters of day-to-day administration. 

4\. Even if expressly enumerated powers and duties can be " vested ", yet they
cannot be transferred in toto, so as to denude the Executive Committee of all
its powers.

5\. In any event the resolution proposed at a meeting of the Executive
Committee held on 19.4.91 - "

It is hereby proposed that the Working Committee of the Party be vested with
full powers to carry out the responsibilities and functions of the National
Executive Committee of the Party " \-

158

is vague, and is ineffective to clothe the Working Committee with disciplinary
powers. Further, the minutes of the meeting do not record that the resolution
was passed.

6\. The Court should adopt a strict construction, presuming, firstly, that the
Party Constitution does not, in general, allow " vesting " or delegation, in
the absence of clear and express provision ; and, secondly, that, even if
there was such provision, disciplinary powers of this nature were not intended
to be transferred.

The minutes of the Executive Committee meeting of 19.4.91 are undoubtedly
defective. Two resolutions are mentioned, but it is not stated that they were
adopted. Had there been no other material, I would have held that the
Executive Committee had not vested its disciplinary powers in the Working
Committee. However, the Petitioners were ex officio members of the Executive
Committee; they would have had notice of that meeting, and may have been
present ; they could certainly have ascertained what. transpired. It was
averred in the petitions that only the Executive Committee has disciplinary
powers ; the Respondents replied annexing the minutes of the meeting of
19.4.91 whereby, they said, " the powers and functions of the National
Executive Committee were by resolution vested in the Working Committee under
[Rule 8 (3) (m)] ". The Petitioners obtained leave to reply ; however, even in
their counter-affidavits they did not claim that the resolution had not been
passed ; instead they merely questioned the effect of that resolution, by
asserting that it did not enable the Working Committee to exercise the
disciplinary powers vested in the Executive Committee, for the reason that it
purported to effect a Constitutional amendment. If the Petitioners were
seriously contending that the resolution had only been proposed, but not
passed, that allegation should have been made clearly, specifically and
directly. I am satisfied that the resolution had been passed at the meeting,
although the minutes are defective. I also hold that the resolution is not
vague. Although the opening words of Rule 8 (3) refer to " duties ", it
proceeds to enumerate a host of powers, duties and functions. The resolution,
by using the phrase "full powers to carry out the responsibilities and
functions ", manifests an intention to delegate al! powers, duties and
functions, including the " responsibility " and the "function " referred to in
Rule 8 (3) (a) in relation to disciplinary matters.

159

It is clear that discretionary powers, whether conferred by statute or by
agreement, must in general be exercised by the designated repositary of those
powers.

" An element which is essential to the lawful exercise of power is that it
should be exercised by the authority upon whom it is conferred, and by no one
else. The principle is strictly applied, even where it causes administrative
inconvenience, except in cases where it may reasonably be inferred that the
power was intended to be delegable The maxim delegatus non potest delegare is
sometimes invoked as if it embodied some general principle that made it
legally impossible for statutory authority to be delegated. In reality there
is no such principle ; and the maxim plays no real part in the decision of
cases, though it is sometimes used as a convenient label. Its proper home is
in the law of agency, where it expresses the point that a principal who must
accept liability for the acts of his agent need not accept it for the acts of
his agents agent ; but even here there are wide exceptions. In the case of
statutory powers the important question is whether, on a true construction of
the Act, it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's
authority by B. The maxim merely indicates that this is not normally
allowable. For this purpose no distinction need be drawn between delegation
and agency. Whichever term is employed, the question of the true intent of the
Act remains ". (Wade, Administrative Law, 5th Edition pp 319-320)

This is not an instance where from its very nature, the power to delegate can
be inferred. However, Rule 8 (3) (m) appears to permit the Executive Committee
to authorise the Working Committee to exercise powers conferred on the former.
Learned Presidents Counsel's contentions depend almost entirely on the meaning
of the word " vest ": which he seeks to equate to " abdicate ", " renounce "
or " alienate ", permanently and irrevocably. On being asked the ordinary
meaning of the word, in the context of power and authority, his reply was that
it meant " clothe ". In law, where a grantor " clothes " another with power or
authority, there is no implication of a denudation of the grantor's powers,
nor of irrevocability or permanency. That is also the plain meaning of the
word, in every day usage and in literature, as evidenced in

160

Shakespeare's immortal lines : " Man, proud man, dressed in a little brief
authority ". To dress a grantee with authority, or to clothe, or vest, him
with power, does not imply an irrevocable and permanent renunciation of his
powers by the grantor, " Vest " is thus akin to " delegate ", rather than . to
" abdicate ", " Vest " is used in that sense in the Constitution (e.g. in
Articles 118 (g) and 138 (2)). Parliament is authorised by Article 4 (c)
directly to exercise the judicial power of the people in regard to matters
relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and its
Members. If Parliament were, by law passed in terms of Article 138 (2), to "
vest " in the Court of Appeal power and jurisdiction in respect of the
immunities of Members of Parliament, this would be an exercise of legislative
power permitted by, and consistent with, the Constitution. Neither such
exercise, nor the result of such exercise, would be inconsistent with the
Constitution. Therefore no question of amending the Constitution can arise,
and an ordinary law would suffice. In particular, such vesting would not
involve an abdication or alienation of legislative power in violation of
Article 76. In the same way, the Executive Committee is authorised directly to
exercise disciplinary powers ; if by resolution the Executive Committee "
vests " such powers in the Working Committee, that is permitted by, and
consistent with Rule 8 (3) (m). Neither the act, nor the result, of such
vesting is inconsistent with the Party Constitution ; hence no question of
amending the Party Constitution arises, and a resolution is sufficient. A
somewhat similar problem arose in _Wickramabahu v. Herath_ ,(1) where it was
held that

" If in respect of a fundamental right recognised by Article 13 (1) and (2),
an Emergency regulation imposes a restriction which is permitted by Article 15
(7), such regulation does not over-ride, suspend or amend any provision of the
Constitution ; it is a restriction permitted by the Constitution, and is both
intra vires and consonant with the Constitution, and therefore does not 'over-
ride' the Constitution."

I hold that the exercise of a power to " vest " permitted by Rule 8 (3) (m)
does not over-ride or conflict with the Rules, but is consistent with the
Rules, and requires no amendment of the Rules.

The Petitioners further contend that Rule 8 (3) (m) does not expressly permit
the transfer of disciplinary powers, and that,. even

161

if it did, both the nature of those powers and the nature of the two
Committees justify a presumption that the Rules did not contemplate any
delegation. Undoubtedly, that Rule does not specifically authorise delegation
of disciplinary powers : it might have said " all or any of the powers and
functions ", or " including those specified in paragraph (a) ", and the matter
would then have been unarguable. But in my view such a provision was
unnecessary. Rule 8 (3) (m) as it stands makes express provision covering the
vesting of disciplinary powers

".............express provision is provision the applicability of which does
not arise by inference....... The fact that the language used is wide and
comprehensive and covers many points other than the one immediately under
discussion does not make it possible to say that its application can arise by
inference only. To be 'express provision' with regard to something it is not
necessary that thing should be specially mentioned ; it is sufficient that it
is directly covered by the language however broad the language may be which
covers it so long as the applicability arises directly from the language used
and not by inference therefrom. Shanmugam v. Commissioner for Registration of
I. and P. Residents (2).

There is neither a prohibition on vesting any of the enumerated powers and
functions, nor any restriction permitting delegation only in respect of minor
or routine matters. Although Rule 8 (2) refers to the Executive Committee as "
the administrative authority ", there are numerous other Rules directly
conferring important administrative powers and functions on the Working
Committee, such as

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision, the Working Committee has the power
to dissolve any District Balamandalaya, Polling Division Organisation, or Main
Association (Rule 2A(4)).

(b) The Nomination Board appointed by the Working Committee, in consultation
with the Working Committee; shall nominate a candidate for the Presidency
(Rule 9 (a)), as well as candidates for other elections (Rule 9(b)).

(c) When a vacancy occurs in the office of President, the Parliamentary Party
in a joint session with the Working Committee shall select the Party candidate
(Rule 9 (c)).

162

(d)  It has the power to approve the constitution and the recognition of local
and affiliated organisations (Rules 2A(1), 2A(2), 2A(6) and 3(1)(e)).

(e)  It may issue directives to members as to their attitude at elections
where there is no Party candidate (Rule 3 (1)(c)).

(f)  It has power to correct any mistake or omission in, and to give necessary
directions in the interpretation and implementation of, the Party Constitution
(Rule 21).

The Party Constitution thus does not treat the Working Committee as a
subordinate body to be entrusted only with routine matters of daily
administration. I hold that Rule 8 (3) (m) expressly empowered the Executive
Committee to vest all or any of its powers and duties whether expressly
enumerated or not. The delegation in question does not purport to be permanent
or irrevocable, and thus there has been in fact no " denudation " of its
powers by the Executive Committee; it is unnecessary to consider whether any
such " denudation " would be of no effect. Its size, the difficulty of having
frequent meetings, and the complexity of the decision-making process in a
large body, are matters which the Executive Committee could legitimately have
taken into account in delegating its powers to a smaller Working Committee
selected from among its own members ; the Executive Committee remained free at
any subsequent meeting to revoke or vary such delegation. In particular, it
could justifiably have taken the view that the advantage of itself conducting
disciplinary inquiries was far outweighed by the disadvantages.

It remains to consider the final submission that it is easier to delegate an
administrative function than a judicial function : _Young v. Fife Regional
Council_ ,(3) ; and that even if all other powers and duties may be delegated
very different considerations apply to the delegation of disciplinary powers:

" A statutory power to delegate functions, even if expressed in wide general
terms, will not necessarily extend to everything. Thus it has been held that
the General Medical Council must itself exercise its disciplinary powers over
dentists and cannot delegate them to its executive committee, even though it
has express statutory power to act through such a committee for the purpose

163

of its functions under the Dentists Acts. In the case of Important judicial.
and disciplinary functions the court may be disposed to construe general
powers of delegation restrictively." (Wade, Administrative Law, 5th Edition p.
325)

_General Medical Council v. U. K. Dental Board_ (4) is cited. Under the Act of
1878, the Council had no power to delegate its disciplinary powers ; it could
ascertain the facts through a Committee. In 1921, the law was amended, by
establishing the Dental Board. The Council continued to have disciplinary
powers, but the Dental Board was in effect substituted for the Committee. The
1921 Act further provided that the Council, for the purpose of its functions,
had power to act by an executive committee of the Council. It was held that
the Council could not delegate its disciplinary powers to such executive
committee. The apparently wide terms of the latter provision were on
examination found to be inconsistent with the detailed scheme, existing from
1878, under which the Council exercised disciplinary powers, after obtaining a
report from the Committee (and later the Dental Board). It was held that the
wide terms of that provision were necessarily restricted by the other, and
inconsistent, provisions of the statute. In the Party Constitution, there is
no such inconsistency. Further the Working Committee possesses as already
noted, power analogous to the disciplinary power, namely to dissolve member
organisations.

Learned President's Counsel was able to point only to two features of the
Party Constitution as militating against delegation of disciplinary powers.
Rule 8 (2) makes the decisions of the Executive Committee final, subject to
review by the Party Convention. If disciplinary powers are delegated to the
Working Committee, this right of review will be lost. It is not clear whether
" review " includes the right to reverse or vary a disciplinary order, but
assuming that it does, it appears to me that a decision of the Working
Committee, in the exercise of delegated authority, will, for the purpose of
Rule 8 (2), be deemed to be the decision of the Executive Committee, i.e. a
decision made vicariously by the Executive Committee and therefore subject to
review just as a decision made directly : quio facit per alium facit per se.
The second matter urged by him was that the allegations against the
Petitioners related to questions of policy, and policy was a matter for
definition by the Executive Committee (Rule) 9 (f)) ; hence the Executive
Committee was best qualified to

164

determine what policy was, and whether it had been violated. That is not a
consideration applicable to the delegation of disciplinary powers in general,
but only against delegation in matters involving policy. In any event, it is
not necessary, and may not even be desirable, that the body which lays down
policy should determine whether there has been an infraction : just as
legislatures are generally not considered best suited to determine whether the
laws enacted by them have been infringed. On the other hand, it is perfectly
reasonable to infer that a body with 2500 members was never intended to
exercise powers of a quasi-judicial nature, especially where facts had to be
inquired into.

I therefore hold that the Executive Committee was authorised to, and did
validly, vest in or delegate to the Working Committee its disciplinary powers
under Rule 8 (3) (m). Although argued at length, it is unnecessary to decide
the further question whether the " endorsement " by the Executive Committee of
the decision of the Working Committee constituted a valid ratification
thereof.

**5\. THE GROUNDS FOR EXPULSION**

**(a) Position of Member of Parliament vis-a-vis his Party**

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the position of
a member of Parliament vis-a-vis the political party to which he belonged at
the time of election, and his rights, powers and privileges to speak and act
according to his own conscience and independent judgement, was governed by the
following principles

(i) Prior to 1978, a Member was not a mere delegate of his Party, and enjoyed
complete freedom of action and decision making; there was no legal fetter on
his conduct in Parliament.

(ii) This position was not changed by the 1978 Constitution, and the 14th
Amendment, which did not reduce a Member to a mere cog in the Party machine.
Despite the introduction of Proportional representation, other " pivotal "
provisions (especially Article 4 (a)) in regard to the position of Members
remained unchanged. The 14th Amendment could not be regarded as having altered
those provisions by implication, in view of Article 82 (1) and (6).

165

(iii) A Member of Parliament is " immune from the dictatorship of the
political party to which he belongs " because under Article 4 (a), read with
Article 3, he is an elected " representative " of the people, and not a mere
"delegate ". Parliament exercises the sovereignty of the people, and the
essence of sovereignty is that the body declared sovereign is free of any
external restraints and is not subordinate to any other body.

(iv) Article 3 provides that sovereignty includes fundamental rights (cf.
Article 4 (d)) among which are freedom of thought, conscience, speech and
expression.

(v) Article 67 preserves the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament
and its Members ; these include freedom of speech and proceedings in
Parliament. If a Member cannot be sued in the Courts in respect of such
matters, his conduct cannot be impeached before the Party Working Committee,
nor can he be asked why he did not first resort to internal procedures.

(vi) Constitutional provisions in regard to the President (Article 42) and the
Cabinet (Article 43) establish that both are answerable to Parliament. It
makes no difference that Article 42 makes the President only " responsible ",
while Article 43 makes the Cabinet " collectively responsible and answerable
"; for " responsible " includes " answerable ". This demonstrates that on
occasion Members of Parliament sit in judgement over President and Cabinet,
and in that sphere they must necessarily be completely independent.

Learned President's Counsel referred us to Edmund Burke's famous speech to the
electors of Bristol in 1774:

" Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile
interests ; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate,
against other agents and advocates ; but parliament is a deliberative assembly
of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole ; where not local
purposes, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, resulting
from the general reason of the whole. You choose a member indeed; but when you
have chosen him, he is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of
Parliament."

166

In 1888, John Bright proclaimed

" I must follow my own judgement and conscience and not the voice of my Party
leaders."

That may have been true of the sovereign Parliament of the United Kingdom, in
the 18th and 19th centuries ; without a written Constitution ; and with the
type of constituency and the limited franchise of that era. Whether that is
applicable to a non-sovereign legislature, governed by a written Constitution,
which recognises the sovereignty of the people and provides for a separation
of functions, in the context of the development of the Party system, I doubt.
The theory that a Member enjoys absolute and unfettered freedom of judgement
and action does not seem to be accepted even in the U.K.. Thus Laski observes

" It is sometimes suggested that a member of the legislative assembly must be
either a delegate or a representative, must either vote as he is instructed,
or use his best judgement upon the issues he is called upon to decide. That
is, in fact, a wholly false antithesis. For no member can state his total
views ; partly because there is not the time to do so, partly because new
issues are bound to arise. And upon those new issues he cannot, item by item,
consult his constituents in such a fashion as to elicit from them their
considered judgement. Any constituency is entitled to the fullest expression
it can get of a member's general attitude. It is entitled to know his views
upon the questions of the day. Any elector may reasonably ask for an
explanation of his political actions. But a member is not the servant of a
party in the majority in his constituency. He is elected to do the best he can
in the light of his intelligence and his conscience. Were he merely a
delegate, instructed by a local caucus, he would cease to have either morals
or personality. Clearly, he is not entitled to get elected as a free trader
and to vote at once for a protective tariff. He is not entitled to get elected
and then to decide on a year's voyage around the world. He must be decently
consistent in opinion, and reasonably diligent in the performance of his
duty." (Grammar of Politics, p. 319)

It is recognised that the Party is entitled to exert pressure on a Member

167

" Threats of disciplinary action against Members by Party Whips have been
ruled not to constitute infringements of the privilege of freedom of speech
because they are part of the conventionally established machinery of political
organisation within the House. Nevertheless, pressure exerted on a member by
the Whips may influence his conduct far more significantly than any connection
he may have with any outside interest group." (S. A. de Smith, Constitutional
& Administrative Law, p. 323)

Similar principles have been laid down in regard to members of elected
councils, in terms suggesting that they are the principles applicable to
Parliament. A council member ought to give considerable weight to the policies
announced in the election manifesto of his party ( _Bromley L.B.C. v. Greater
London Council_ (5), Secretary of State for Education & Science v. _Tameside
Metropolitan Borough_ (6) ; and to party policy and the views of party
colleagues(7) ; _R. v. Greenwich L.B.C._ (8). It is implicit that a member
must therefore take steps to consult his colleagues. He ought not to treat
himself as irrevocably bound to carry out policies, set out in the party
manifesto, if subsequently there have been unforeseen and significant changes
of circumstances (Bromley, at pp 165-166, 182) ; or to " vote blindly in
support of party policy " (Waltham Forest, at pp 676-677). He must exercise
his own judgment upon every question which, the Council has to decide
(Greenwich L.B.C. at p 525) ; he must make up his own mind without abdicating
personal responsibility (Waltham Forest, at p 676). It would therefore be a
breach of his fiduciary duty to fetter his own discretion by a pre-determined
acceptance, to the exclusion of all other considerations, of a decision made
by a political party, or a caucus of that party, as, for example, to vote
against his own assessment of the merits solely to conform to a party
manifesto issued prior to his election, or to pre-determined party policy
(Waltham Forest, at p 677). However, the adoption of a " whip " system whereby
members are required to refrain from speaking or voting against the group
decision (subject to recognised exceptions) is not objectionable (Waltham
Forest, at p 674) ; but " it is not possible to have a party policy as to the
existence of facts and they have to be determined by each member on the
evidence." There is nothing morally or legally culpable in voting in support
of a majority which has considered, and rejected, a member's arguments,
provided he considers all the

168

options and decides that the maintenance of party loyalty, party unanimity and
party policy is of greater importance than his personal views and inclinations
(Waltham Forest, at p 677). The law does not forbid pressure being exerted on
him by his colleagues and the party whip (Greenwich L.B.C., at p 525). In that
case eight Labour members of the Council's housing committee voted against,
and thereby prevented, a proposed increase in rents. The majority Labour Group
then decided that the committee should be re-constituted, and that new members
be appointed in order to have the rent increase approved. At its next meeting
the Council so decided, and the new committee thereafter approved the
increase. Having expressed some doubt as to whether Burke's pronouncement was
wholly in accord with current political wisdom, the court held that the
Council was entitled to expect its Committees to promote its policy, and
therefore also to remove members who obstruct such policy. This was not a
punishment of the dissident members. The law does not forbid sanctions for
voting contrary to the wishes of those who have power to impose them the party
whip may be withdrawn, constituents may decline to re-elect, or the local
party may deselect ; these are not unlawful or an improper fetter on the
members.

" At the present day when local government is organised on party lines, some
additional constraints resulting from the existence of a party line or
strategy on particular issues are inevitable ...... A political party is
entitled to take steps to ensure its cohesion and I can see nothing
intrinsically wrong in a decision to change a party's representation on a
committee ...... to advance the policies which the party considers desirable
......... group discipline does not connote punishment but an attempt to keep
the group together." (Greenwich LB.C. at p 523)

These observations go further than what was stated in Waltham Forest

What would be objectionable would be a provision that a member had forthwith
to resign his membership of the council, if, in the absence of a conscience
situation, he intended to vote contrary to group policy." (p. 674)

169

The Petitioners rely on this for their contention that expulsion is equally
objectionable. However, these observations were made in the absence of
legislation permitting that sanction, and seem inapplicable to Sri Lanka as
Article 99 (13) (a) expressly recognises the power of expulsion. Such
expulsion is permissible only if the Member is also a member of that parry ; a
candidate who wishes to be free of party control seems free to avoid that
sanction by the simple expedient of giving up his membership prior to
election.

A voluntary association is a collection of individuals who have agreed to come
together, for a common purpose, under a single leader or a collective
leadership. A political party is a voluntary association the common objective
of whose members is to secure governmental power on the basis of its declared
political, economic and social principles, policies and programmes. How an
association deals with internal dissent and conflict would vary according to
its objectives : a group with religious objectives may thus be more strict in
this respect than a social group. A political party which is in its formative
period, seeking to attract a wide membership, may be more lenient, than an
established party ; one seeking to gain power may be more accommodating than
one which is in power. However, all political parties, seeking mass support,
need to be cohesive ; this requires internal unity and loyalty. To attain
their objectives, they need to be effective ; problems and conflicts have to
be internally resolved. These are features common to all groups. Thus group
norms, or common standards of behaviour, are implicit. Members of a political
party who find themselves unable to agree with their colleagues in regard to
objectives, leadership and any other aspect of their " group " are subject to,
at least, an implied obligation to bring up contentious issues for internal
discussion and resolution in the first instance. That is a duty they have in
common with all groups, small or big, insignificant or important. Thus dissent
in the family must first be discussed within the family circle, before being
raised by a parent in the workplace or a child in the classroom. At the other
end of the scale, disagreement among members of the Cabinet must first be
raised within, before being ventilated in public ; collective responsibility
and confidentiality are not artificial rules but practical norms essential for
proper functioning. That obligation exists quite independent of express
provisions in the Party Rules. Those Rules must not be interpreted without
regard to the realities underlying all associations and groups. The question
therefore

170

is not whether the obligation to discuss internally can be constructed out of
little bits and pieces, gathered from here and there in the Rules that members
must not bring the Party into disrepute (Rule 3 (1) (d)), that they must give
a pledge on obtaining Party nomination, to abide by the Party Rules (Rule
9(d)), that Members of Parliament must subscribe a pledge of loyalty to the
Parry (Rule 17 (1)), that Members must take every opportunity to raise
internally questions of Party policy about which they are doubtful (Rule 17
(6)), etc. It is not by asking whether " Party Policy " includes the
suitability of a particular individual to be the leader ; or asking " what is
loyalty? " The Party Constitution does not manifest an intention to displace a
fundamental obligation of a member of a political party, that dissent in
regard to basic objectives and leadership must first be internally raised and
discussed ; on the contrary, several providence such as those just mentioned
re-inforce that obligation.

The question arises whether the Executive Presidential system is a fundamental
principle of the Party Policy. The fifth recital in the expulsion resolution
unambiguously asserts this. There is not a word to the contrary in the
petition. In the Respondents' objections it was stated.

" It has been and is the policy of the United National Party since 1977 that
the government of Sri Lanka should consist of a Executive President elected by
the people and an elected Parliament. This system of Government was first
advocated by the Party in the General Election campaign of 1977 and accepted
by the majority of voters. Thereafter, the United National Party Government
effected Constitutional changes in 1978 to bring into existence the Executive
Presidential System. At subsequent elections also over the past twelve years,
where this system was criticised by Opposition Parties, the United National
Party consistently supported the same and succeeded at all such elections."

In the Petitioner's counter-affidavits there was a bare denial together with
the further plea that

" by the adoption of an 'Executive Presidential System of Government' neither
the United National Party nor its membership were irrevocably committed to the
continuance of this system of government nor were they precluded from
agitating for its reform

171

 once anomalies in its working and the consequent abuse or misuse of executive
power was observed in its working. The reform of the Constitution in regard to
this new feature of government was within the objectives of the Party....."

The Petitioners thus did not deny that the Executive Presidential system was
since 1978, and upto August 1991, a fundamental plank of Party policy and
principle ; all that they asserted was that it was not immutable, and that
they had a right to agitate for its reform. I therefore hold that the issues
in regard to leadership and the system of government were matters of prime
importance to the Party, and dissenting views should have been the subject of
prior internal discussion before being ventilated outside Party circles.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners did concede in the course of
his reply that a norm requiring prior internal discussion could be legitimate,
but submitted that after such discussion if the dissentient view did not find
favour with the majority, the minority were at liberty to raise those same
issues publicly ; they were not bound by the Party decision, and therefore, he
sought to argue, the rules regarding prior internal discussion were not
mandatory, not being mandatory, a breach could not be punished. This is a non
sequitur. From the fact that the prescribed procedure does not result in a
binding decision, it cannot be concluded that the procedural rule is not
binding. This can be seen in many contexts : that a party must attempt
conciliation (or mediation) before having recourse to the courts, although he
is not bound to accept a suggested settlement, and may be non-suited if he has
failed to resort to the non-binding conciliation procedure ; that a party must
exhaust administrative remedies, before applying for a prerogative writ. I am
of the view that the internal discussion procedure was mandatory, even if the
internal decision might not be binding.

I discern several significant points of difference under our Constitution. It
is the people who are sovereign, not Parliament. Parliament does not have a
monopoly of legislative power, as there are some laws which it cannot itself
enact, and its refusal to enact an ordinary law can be over-ridden (see
Articles 85 (1) and (2)). The judiciary has a right, although limited, to
check an excess of legislative power, by reviewing Bills for consistency with
the Constitution. From 1978 the Constitution provided that a recognised
political party had the right to expel a member, resulting in vacation

172

of his Parliamentary seat. Learned President's Counsel sought to contend that
this power of expulsion did not extend to conduct qua Member of Parliament,
but there is nothing to justify such a restrictive interpretation of Article
99 (13) (a). Article 99, as first enacted, gave overwhelming prominence to the
party, and not to the individual candidate for election : nomination was of
the party, which determined the order of priority of candidates on the party
list, whose names did not even appear on the ballot paper, and votes were cast
for the party. The 14th, Amendment did away with the pre-determined order of
priority, and enabled the voter, after casting his vote for the party, to
express preferences for candidates. Even before, if was arguable whether
voters were influenced more by the party or the individual candidates, but
after 1978 the choice was primarily between rival parties, although certainly
the identity of the candidates continued to be of some relevance. Hence the
position of the individual Member vis-a-vis his party is undeniably weaker in
Sri Lanka than in the United Kingdom ; he does not enjoy the same freedom to
resign from his party and to cross the floor of the House, and to continue as
a Member. The word " representative in Article 4 (a) is by no means conclusive
in favour of the " free mandate " theory, and the position of a Member has to
be determined by examining the relevant provisions of the Constitution as a
whole. It is neither possible nor necessary in this case to attempt a
comprehensive definition of that position, and it is sufficient to ascertain
whether he retains a power of independent action, in any significant respect.

I take the view that a Member has not been reduced to the position of a mere
cog in the party machine, bereft of any independence of action. While his
relationship to the party tends to suggest that he has no independence, some
of his constitutional functions are essentially discretionary and quasi-
judicial ; some even judicial. Thus Article 4 (c) enables Parliament to
exercise the judicial power of the people in regard to matters concerning
Parliamentary privilege ; in determining, both the facts and the law, as to
whether a Member or an outsider has committed a breach of privilege, it is
unthinkable - in the absence of specific provision to that effect \- that the
Constitution intended a Member to act otherwise than judicially. In exercising
power to remove high officers (Commissioner of Elections, Auditor-General, and
Ombudsman : Articles 103 (3) (e), 153 (3) (e) and 156 (4) (e)) and Judges
(Article 107 (2)), a Member likewise performs not just a discretionary
administrative function, but a

173

quasi-judicial function, for there can be no party policy as to the existence
of facts warranting removal, which must be determined solely on the evidence.
If he did not, a serious question may well arise as to whether Parliament is
an institution whose judicial functions are liable to judicial review for
instance under Article 140. That I do not have to decide, but it is clear that
Members do have certain discretionary functions, were they must not act under
dictation. In considering whether a Member has a similar discretion under
Article 38 (2), it is relevant that the like power under Article 107 (2) is
quasi-judicial. It is also relevant that under Article 37 (2), the Chief
Justice in forming an opinion, in consultation with the Speaker, that the
President is temporarily unable to discharge the duties of his office, is
clearly required to act judicially. If that opinion is formed on account of
physical infirmity, which thereafter persists, and if Parliament is then
called upon to act under Article 38 (2) (a), in respect of that same
infirmity, can it be that Parliament is not required to act judicially? It
seems to me that if " suspension " from office requires the exercise of an
independent discretion, then necessarily the entire process of " removal '
must also be discretionary ; party policy and party discipline may apply, in
the same way as such considerations legitimately apply to other discretions,
but the decision is ultimately one of conscience and independent judgement.
Learned President's Counsel for the Respondents strenuously contended that the
removal of a President must be looked at very differently from the removal of
Judges and high officers, because the President is directly elected by the
people, and his election and continuance in office involve questions of policy
and politics ; he thus attempted to minimise the element of discretion.
Article 38 (2) has placed three hurdles in the path of removal of a President;
accepting this contention would add a fourth, namely approval by the majority
in one or more party Parliamentary groups, and this may well be an
insurmountable barrier, which will make Article 38 (2) inoperative. That
contention must fail for another reason as well ; Article 38 (2) applies
equally to a President not directly elected by the people, for it is possible
for a Member to be elected President, under Article 40, even though he has
never faced any election in his life (e.g. if he was nominated to Parliament
under Article 99A).

174

(b) Signing the notice, and agitating for Constitutional change

It would be quite unrealistic to treat these as two unconnected and severable
issues. The Petitioners' position is that defects and anomalies in the working
of the Executive Presidential system enabled abuse and misuse of executive
power by the President ; when such abuse and misuse were observed, the need
arose for removal ; and it was only then that the necessity for constitutional
reform was realised. It is implicit in this position that but for such alleged
abuse and misuse of power, they would not have appreciated the need, and would
not have agitated, for constitutional change.

The Petitioners contend that they had a constitutional right to sign the
notice of resolution, exercising their independent judgment and discretion, by
virtue of Article 38 (2), and also that such conduct could not have been
questioned in any place outside Parliament, by virtue of the Parliament
(Powers and Privileges) Act ; they were entitled to campaign for the abolition
of the Executive Presidential system unfettered by any restraint imposed by
the Party Rules, policy and principles, by virtue of their fundamental rights
under Articles 10 and 14 (1) (a).

For the reasons already stated, I hold that any Member of Parliament was
entitled to sign the notice of resolution in the exercise of his independent
judgement and discretion ; and that signing a notice intended to be presented,
and in fact presented, to Parliament, in respect of a matter within its
province, is a " proceeding in Parliament." I also hold that freedom of speech
(and thought, conscience, and expression) clearly embraces the people's right
to know, the wide dissemination of information and opinions, the public
discussion of all matters of public concern, and criticism, however strongly
worded, and even if foolish and without moderation, of public measures and
government action ; all this, of course, by peaceful means and without
incitement to violence. Relevant authorities have been cited and discussed by
Sharvananda, C.J., in Joseph Perera v. A. G. (9).

However, that does not entitle the Petitioners to relief, because they are
also charged with the failure to raise these matters internally.

175

(c) Failure to initiate prior internal discussions

I have already held that the Petitioners were under a duty in this respect.
However it is their contention that even if there be such a duty in general,
yet upon a conflict between constitutional and statutory rights on the one
hand, and rights or duties arising from private agreements (and in their
submission the Party Rules fell into this category) on the other, the latter
must give way. Kelsen's hierarchy of norms was relied on. Certainly, this
contention would prevail if the grundnorm, or a superior norm, said " You
shall do A ", while an inferior norm purported to say " You shall not do A ".
But the normative conflict here is between norms of a different sort : the
superior norm says " You may do A ", while the (allegedly) inferior norm says,
in effect, " You may do A, provided you first do B ". There is thus no real
conflict. The " rights " that the Petitioners rely on are not true rights, in
Hohfeld's classification, with correlative duties ; Articles 11 and 13 (1) are
examples of rights of that kind. Articles 10 and 14 (1) (a), and the
Parliamentary privileges and immunities relied on, are not " rights " but "
liberties " or " privileges ", without correlative duties. The Party Rules
prescribe, consensually, only pre-conditions for the exercise of those
liberties, implicit in each of which was a genuine option ; the petitioners
were free to accept or regard such pre-conditions, but once accepted they were
binding.

In that background, I am of the view that the obligation to initiate prior
internal discussions was valid and binding on the petitioners for several
reasons.

(i) In regard to freedom of speech, I do riot agree that in our law " any
system of prior restraints of expression bear a heavy presumption against its
constitutional validity ' (New York Times v. U.S. (10) . The American Bill of
Rights was primarily directed against State action, and made no express
provision in respect of permitted restrictions. These had therefore to be
judicially prescribed. Our fundamental rights are differently defined, and are
available not only as against the State but as against all others ;
permissible restrictions are specified in detail. There is thus no reason to
interpret them with " heavy presumptions ", one way or the other. The
Respondents relied heavily on _Dissanayake v. Sri Jayawardenepura University_
(11), which has been the subject of critical analysis in an article by

176

Prof. G. L. Peiris and Erick Jensen in (1989) 38 I.C.L.Q. 788. That decision
suggests that the State has the power to regulate freedom of speech in areas
outside those specified in Article 15 (2) and (7), and otherwise than by law ;
that a student by entering the University consents to the regulation of his
constitutional rights in keeping with the special characteristics of the
University environment. From this the Respondents argue that the Petitioners,
by their membership of the Party, consented to the Party regulating their
freedom of speech. I am unable to agree to this wide proposition as to the
State's right to regulate fundamental rights. However, I am of the opinion
that the freedom of speech is subject to three limitations. First, limitations
which are intrinsically inherent in the freedom itself ; the familiar example,
that no one has the freedom of speech falsely to shout " fire " in a crowded
place and to cause panic. Next, Articles 15 (2) and (7) permit certain
restrictions to be prescribed by law ; and it seems to follow both that such
restrictions cannot be prescribed otherwise than by law, and that even by law
other or further restrictions cannot be prescribed. Finally, since freedom of
speech is a " liberty " (and not a " right "), a citizen has always an option,
to exercise his right, or not to exercise it, or to exercise it subject to
some limitation. Such limitations would usually be accepted for the sake of
some benefit or advantage. Thus the bank employee who signs a non-statutory
declaration of secrecy, can hardly be heard to complain that his freedom of
speech has been denied by his employer so also the Attorney-at-law who accepts
judicial office, and finds that by convention he is debarred from speaking out
on various issues. When Ruth entreated Naomi, " Whither thou goest, I will go
and where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy
God my God ", there was no incipient violation of her freedoms of religion,
residence and movement, but only a voluntary self limitation. The politician
who joins a political party in order to enter Parliament can validly subject
himself to a condition which regulates, without denying, his freedom of
speech. If you wish to play cricket, you must accept the rules of cricket ; if
you are selected for the team, it is very likely that you will have to agree
to procedures about changing the captain.

(ii) There is a further consideration. The Petitioners' case was presented
throughout as if only their rights, and fundamental rights, were involved. The
Party Rules involve all the other members as well. What of their rights? Just
as the Petitioners agreed not to criticise

177

their Party and colleagues in public, without prior internal discussion, so
also their fellow-members undertook a reciprocal obligation not to criticise
the Petitioners. That is not all. The Petitioners sought to relegate the Party
Rules to the lowest level in the hierarchy of norms. But Article 99 (13) (a)
impliedly recognises at least one aspect of the Party Rules and discipline.
More important, the rules of a political party are not a mere matter of
contract, but the basis of the exercise of the freedom of association
recognised by Article 14 (1) (c) (and by section 18 (1) (f) of the 1972
Constitution). One of the conditions. on which Party members agreed to
exercise this fundamental right was by mutually accepting reciprocal
obligations placing limitations on the exercise of the freedom of speech by
each other, in the interests of their association. Hence no question of
superior and inferior norms arises. Inherent in the two freedoms is the
liberty to make necessary adjustments. As between freedom of association and
Parliamentary privilege, it can hardly be said that the latter is a " superior
" norm.

(iii) Insofar as Parliamentary privilege is concerned, learned President's
Counsel for the Petitioners was forced to concede that the conduct of a Member
in Parliament can be questioned outside Parliament by a political party or
other Association of which he was a member. He submitted that this was limited
to matters which were fundamental: if a Member spoke or voted in Parliament
against a particular economic or religious principle or doctrine which was
fundamental to such party, or if a member of a temperance association
advocated the consumption of liquor, disciplinary action was permissible. He
submitted that supporting a resolution for the removal of the President could
never be fundamental, because it could never be a fundamental policy or
principal of a party that a particular individual should continue to hold that
office. In answer to the question whether a Member guilty of some serious
misconduct in Parliament, but leniently dealt with - either because Parliament
chose to treat it lightly or because Parliament lacked the power to impose a
greater penalty - could be penalised by his party, he doubted whether that was
permissible. But that would mean that a political party cannot insist on
higher standards of conduct than Parliament : which I doubt. If conduct can be
questioned in regard to fundamental matters. I see no reason why it cannot be
questioned in regard to other matters, because the law itself makes no such
distinction. However, it is clear from Counsel's concession that there is an
area in which disciplinary

178

action is permissible. In the United Kingdom, Parliament is not only sovereign
but is the " High Court of Parliament "; and Parliament can by an ordinary law
define its privileges in any terms it pleases. The doctrine restricting review
by the ordinary courts must be viewed in that context. But the charge in the
present case relates essentially to a matter outside the area of proceedings
in Parliament, and anterior to conduct in Parliament. Whatever the position as
to the act of signing, I am of the view that the Petitioners' conduct in
regard to the failure to observe the pre-condition as to internal discussions
could be questioned in disciplinary proceedings leading to an order of
expulsion as contemplated in Article 99 (13) (a).

**(d) Causing insult and injury to the President**

There is not a word in the 2nd Respondent's statement to the Working Committee
on this matter ; no specific acts are mentioned. Although he did refer to
newspaper reports, these have not been identified in the minutes of that
meeting. The newspaper reports produced contain some critical statements, but
we cannot be certain that these were produced to the Working Committee ; some
of the statements are ambiguous. The Working Committee could not have regarded
this charge as having been proved, and expulsion on that ground cannot be
justified.

**(e) Deceiving the Cabinet**

This charge has been clearly and precisely referred to in the 2nd Respondent's
statement and in the expulsion resolution ; there is no ambiguity or
uncertainty as to the facts. Expulsion on this ground was proper. I will deal
with this later.

**6\. BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE : (a) audi alteram partem:**

It is admitted that the Petitioners were neither informed of the allegations
and the evidence against them, nor afforded an opportunity (i) to submit an
explanation (ii) to be heard in their defence or (iii) to make any
submissions, on the law or the facts, as to whether misconduct warranting
disciplinary action had been proved, and, if so, whether a lesser penalty than
expulsion was appropriate.

179

The powers of public authorities, and of certain other bodies, are subject to
control in two ways : what they can do is circumscribed by legal rules
relating to jurisdiction and so on ; how they exercise their powers and
discretions is governed by principles of natural justice, which are a code of
fair administrative procedures devised by the courts. These procedural rules
are by no means merely technical, or of secondary importance ; or a tiresome
waste of time impeding efficiency. With the growing complexity of modern
society, the citizen is constantly affected by the exercise of powers of
various kinds, and procedural fairness increases in importance.

" Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable essence of
liberty. Severe substantive laws can be endured if they are fairly and
impartially applied......... due process of law is not for the sole benefit of
an accused. It is the best insurance for the Government it self against those
blunders which leave lasting stains on a system of justice but which are bound
to occur on ex parte consideration." ( _Shauqhnessy v. U.S._ (12))

" The history of liberty has largely been the history of observance of
procedural saferguards." ( _Mcllabb v. U.S._ (13))

The most fundamental principle of natural justice is the audi alteram partem
rule, which is an obvious principle of justice applicable in all judicial
proceedings. Natural justice is not now considered to be part of some
fundamental and immutable law, constituting a fetter on the legislative power
; today the courts presume, unless the contrary appears, that the legislature
intended that powers conferred by it be exercised fairly, for ' although there
are no positive words in a statute, requiring that the party shall be heard,
yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature
" ( _Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works_ (14), _Mersey Docks (etc) Trustees
v. Gibbs_ (15). Whether this principle extends into non-judicial spheres was
for long a matter of serious controversy, but it can now be regarded as
settled that -

" This rule is not confined to the conduct of strictly legal tribunals, but is
applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to
adjudicate upon matters involving civil

180

consequences to individuals." _Wood v. Wood_ (16), cf _Byrne v. Kinematograph
Renters Society Ltd_.,(17).

There was a series of decisions (e.g. _Franklin v. Minister of Town and
Country Planning_ (18), _Nakkuda Ali v. Jayaratne_ (19), R V. Metropolitan
Police Commissioner _ex p. Parker_ (20), over a period of about three decades
- which Professor Wade labels " the retreat from natural justice " \- which
constituted a severe setback to the development of this branch of the law.
However, that period of confusion ended with Ridge v. Baldwin (21), when the
older authorities were re-affirmed.

It was uncertain at one time whether " purely administrative " powers were
subject to the audi alteram partem rule, or only " judicial " powers, and
considerable judicial ingenuity was exercised to characterise administrative
powers as " judicial " or "quasijudicial " to justify intervention (as in
_Hall v. Manchester Crop_ (22), Hopkins vi(23), Urban Housing _Co. Ltd. V.
Oxford City Council_ (24).

However, the older authorities, particularly _Cooper v. Wandsworm Board of
Works, Wood v. Woad, and Board of Education v. Rice_ (25) , recognised the
universality of the audi alteram partem rule in its application to
administrative powers in general. In Cooper, a builder commenced erection of a
building, without giving seven days notice to the Board as required by statute
; the Board thereupon exercised its statutory power to demolish the building ;
the builder's action for damages succeeded on the ground that the Board had no
power to act without giving him notice and allowing him to be heard. While
Erie, CA., considered the exercise of the Board's power to be " in the nature
of judicial proceedings ", Willes, J., thought that a tribunal invested with
power to affect property rights is bound to give an opportunity of being heard
before it proceeds, and Byles, J., held that the Board was wrong whether it
acted judicially or ministerially. In Rice, Lord Loreburn, L.C., dealing with
the Board's power to discriminate between teachers in church schools and in
its own schools, put it in much broader terms

181

".......... what comes for determination is sometimes a matter to be settled
by discretion, involving no law. It will, I suppose, usually be of an
administrative kind ; but sometimes it will involve matter of law as well as
matter of fact, or even depend upon matter of law alone. In such cases the
Board of Education will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the
facts. I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and
listen fairly to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who
decides anything .........."

Ridge v. Baldwin settled that question. Lord Reid explained how the mere fact
that the power affects rights or interests makes natural justice applicable to
its exercise, and re-affirmed the older authorities which clearly showed how
the courts engrafted the principles of natural justice on to a host of
provisions authorising administrative interference with private rights. Lord
Hodson was explicit :

".........the answer in a given case is not provided by the statement that the
giver of the decision is acting in an executive or administrative capacity as
if that were the antithesis of a judicial capacity. The cases seem to me to
show that persons acting in a capacity which is not on the face of it judicial
but rather executive or administrative have been held by the courts to be
subject to the principles of natural justice." (at p. 130)

These views were later affirmed in no uncertain terms. Lord Denning, M.R.,
observed (in _R v. Gaming Board for G.B_.(26) that the heresy that the
principles of natural justice only apply to judicial proceedings, and not to
administrative proceedings, was scotched in _Ridge v. Baldwin. In Schmidt v.
Home Secretary_ (27), he held that an administrative body may be bound to give
a person who is affected by its decision an opportunity of making
representations, if he has some right or interest, or even some legitimate
expectation, of which it would not be fair to deprive him without hearing what
he has to say. _Lord Diplock (in A.G. v. Ryan_ (28) ) held that a person
having legal authority to determine a question affecting the rights of
individuals is, by necessary implication, required to observe the principles
of natural justice when exercising that authority, and that if he fails to do
so, his purported decision is a nullity.

182

A decision made by an unbiased tribunal, after duly considering the views of
those likely to be affected by it, is not only more likely to be correct, but
will be more acceptable and of better quality. Fairness to the individual
facilitates a better decision by the tribunal. The duty to give a fair hearing
is as much a canon of good administration as of good legal or judicial
procedure.

Thus today natural justice controls the exercise not only of judicial power
but of practically all powers and discretions. In public law areas, it applies
to powers conferred by statute relating to property, office or status (e.g. to
demolish buildings ; Cooper v. Wandsworth ; Urban Housing Co. v. Oxford City
Council, to dismiss a public officer _Ridge v. Baldwin ; Cooper v. Wilsom_
(29) ; _Kanda v. Federation of Malaya_ (30), Chief Constable (North Wales) v.
Evans (31)), but not in respect of an office held " at pleasure ", where
dismissal without cause being assigned is authorised, or where the
relationship is simply that of " master and servant " : _Ridge v. Baldwin ;
cf. Vidyodaya University v. Silva_ (32) ; to register an applicant for
citizenship : A.G. v. Ryan; to dissolve a local authority ; _Durayappah v.
Fernando_ (33), to make zoning orders regulating the supply of dairy products:
Jeffs v. N.Z. Dairy Products (etc) Board (34), to suspend or dismiss
registered dock workers : _Barnard v. National Dock Labour Board_ (35), cf.
Vine v. National Dock Labour Board (36). Natural justice applies in many other
areas, such as membership and office in trade unions (Lawlor v. Union of Post
Office Workers (3 Burn v. National Amalgamated Labourers Union (38), Abbott v.
Sullivan (39), Lee v. Showmen's Guild (40), Taylor v. National Union of Seamen
(41), Annamunthodo v. Oilfield Workers Trust Union (42), Stevenson v. United
Road Transport Union (43)), societies (Wood v. Woad, at p. 196 ; Byrne v.
Kinematograph Renters Society Ltd; Innes v. Wylie (44), ( _Andrews v. Milchell
(_ 45) ), social clubs (Fisher v. Keane (46), Labouchere v. Wharncliffe (47),
Dawkins v. Antrobus (48), Gray v. Allison (49)), and other private
associations : (R v. Saddlers' Company, ex. p. Dinsdale (50), Johnson v.
Jockey Club of South Africa (51), DArcy v. Adamson (52), Graham v. Sinclair
(53,). Although the rights in question arose essentially from contract, a fair
hearing was a pre-condition to deprivation of rights or to imposition of
penalties and disabilities being an implied term of such contract (Dawkins v.
Antrobus (54), Wood v. Woad, at p. 196 ; Lee v. Showmen's Guild, at p. 342 ;
Burn v. National Amalqamated Labourers Union), any agreement or practice to
the contrary being invalid (Abbott v.

183

Sullivan (55) , per Denning LJ., dissenting ; Edward v. SOGAY (56) , Lee v.
Showmen's Guild, at p. 342). It also applies to ecclesiastical rights and
offices : (R v. Archbishop of Canterbury (57), Capel v. Child (58), Bonaker .
v. Evans (59), R v. North, ex. p. Oakey(60) to the deprivation of University
degrees for misconduct (Bentley's Case, R. v. University of Cambridge) (61) ,
Re Perqamon Press Ltd. (62)) ; and to some extent in relation to academic
discipline (University of Ceylon v. Fernando (63), R. 505 ; R. v. Aston
University (64), Blynn v. Keele University (65), cf. Herring v. Templeman
(66)). Exceptionally natural justice applies to some preliminary
investigations as to whether a prima facie case has been established, if
serious legal consequences could ensue (Selvaraian v. Race Relations Board
(67)). Indeed, " there has been a marked expansion of.......... natural
justice and fairness reaching beyond statute and contract : (McInnes v.
Onslow-Fane (68)).

A further source of confusion has been the suggested distinction that " in the
sphere of the so-called quasi-judicial the rules of natural justice run, and
that in the administrative or executive field there is a general duty of
fairness " (Bates v. Lord Hailsham (69), cf. Pearlberg v. Varty (70), Re
Pergamon Press).

" But other judges have expressed what is clearly the preferable view, that
there is no difference in principle between natural justice and 'acting
fairly', but that natural justice is a flexible doctrine whose content may
vary according to the nature of the power and the circumstances of the case.
In the words of Lord Denning, M.R., the rules of natural justice - or of
fairness - are not cut and dried. They vary infinitely. Attempts to represent
natural justice and 'acting fairly' as two different things are a sure sign of
failure to understand that administrative powers are subject to the principles
of natural justice." (Wade, Administrative Law, 5th ed. p. 467).

While I readily accept that exposition of the law, I must add that on the
facts of this case any such distinction would make no difference.

In _Ex. p. Parker_ (71) , Lord Boddard, C.J., held that the exercise of
disciplinary powers was not subject to natural justice:

184

where a person ....... whose duty is to act in matters of discipline, is
exercising disciplinary powers, it is most undesirable ........ that he should
be fettered by threats of orders of certiorari and so forth, because that
interferes with the free and proper exercise of the disciplinary powers which
he has. "

Now, however, it is accepted that disciplinary bodies " must act fairly just
the same as anyone else and are just as subject to control by the courts "
(Buckoke v. Greater London Council (72), R. v. Hull Prison Visitors ex p. St.
Germain (73)).

An expansive, rather than a restrictive, interpretation of the protection
afforded by the principles of natural justice is demanded by the equality
provisions in Article 12 of the Constitution ; fairness lies at the root of
equality and equal protection.

Applying those principles, I do not find it necessary to consider whether the
power of expulsion conferred by the Party Constitution is judicial or quasi-
judicial ; it is a power vested in a body of persons having authority to
determine disputed matters involving civil consequences to individuals ; it
affects their rights and interests. The numerous authorities which I have
cited, are but part of a current - indeed, a flood - of authority, overflowing
the bounds of administrative law and statute, into contract, and even beyond,
which it is too late to stem or to divert. In a democratic multi-party system,
political parties are voluntary associations, and the rights of members are
contractual in nature. There is nothing in the Party Constitution which tends
to place a member in the position of a servant in an ordinary master and
servant relationship, or a person holding office at pleasure. The rights of
members are of far greater importance to the individual, and to the democratic
way of life, than those of members of social clubs ; or even rights relating
to employment and livelihood. These applications are not for certiorari, and
hence it makes no difference that the duty to comply with natural justice
arises from contract, and not from statute. I hold that the power of expulsion
contained in Rule 8 (3) (a) is subject to the principles of natural justice.

Natural justice has been described as " fairplay in action " or " fairness
writ large and judicially ". Even if the applicable standard was not " natural
justice " but " the duty to act fairly ", the power of expulsion has to be
exercised fairly. In my view, fairness required

185

prima facie that the Petitioners be given notice of the allegations and the
material evidence, an opportunity to explain, controvert or mitigate the case
against them, and the right to make submissions. This was not done. This Court
would therefore, in the ordinary course, declare the expulsion to be void ab
initio (Ridge v. Baldwin ; General Medical Council v. Spackman (74), infra).

However it is necessary to consider whether there were any exceptional
circumstances which render the proceedings fair in substance, despite the lack
of notice and hearing. There is no express legislative exemption. The Party
Constitution does not purport to exclude natural justice ; indeed, the 2nd
Respondent, as General Secretary, issued on 8.8.91 " Guidelines for
Disciplinary Inquiries " which embody fundamental concepts of natural justice
; and I have already referred to the authorities indicating that an attempted
exclusion of natural justice would have been invalid. This is also not an
instance in which the very nature of the power, or the urgency for its
exercise, excludes natural justice (White v. Redfern (75) ; R. v. Davey (76)).

There have been cases in which relief has been refused on the ground that
hearing would have made no difference ; but this is a principle to be
sparingly applied.

" If the principles of natural justice are violated in respect of any
decision, it is, indeed, immaterial whether the same decision would have been
arrived at in the absence of the departure from the essential principles of
justice. The decision must be declared to be no decision." (General Medical
Council v. Spackman)

In that case a medical practitioner was a co-respondent in a divorce suit. He
was found guilty of adultery with the respondent, to whom he stood in a
professional relationship. Proceedings were taken by the Council against him
for infamous conduct. To disprove adultery, he sought to lead evidence which
had not been led in the divorce suit ; the Council declined to hear fresh
evidence. The House of Lords held that although the decree in the divorce suit
was prima facie evidence of adultery, the Council, by refusing to hear the
fresh evidence had failed to make due inquiry. It is never easy to say that
the result was obvious from the start:

**186**

" As everybody who has anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the
law is strewn with examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not;
of unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered ; of
inexplicable conduct which was fully explained ; if fixed and unalterable
determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change. Nor are those with any
knowledge of human nature who pause to think for a moment likely to
underestimate the feelings of resentment of those who find that a decision
against them has been made without their being afforded any opportunity to
influence the course of events.' (John v. Ress) (77)

There are however several cases in which orders have been allowed to stand
although made without a hearing. Extracting a consistent set of principles
from these decisions involves, in Tennyson's words,

" Mastering the lawless science of our law, That codeless myriad of precedent,
That Wilderness of single instances, "

through which we have to beat a pathway out to fairness. To these I now turn.

" No legitimate expectation " : In one category of cases it is said that the
victim had no " legitimate expectation ", either of a fair hearing, or of
receiving the benefit he sought. This has no relevance where he already enjoys
a legal right, in respect of property, office, status and the like. The "
legitimate expectation " principle is not a former on the right to a hearing
in those situations, but an extension of the protection of the audi alteram
partem rule to other situations, to persons who do not have legal rights :
such as an applicant for a licence (Mc innes v. Onslow-Fane, R. v. Gaming
Board for G.B., or for the renewal of a licence or permit (Schmidt v. Home
Secretary, or a member of the public, who seeks to be allowed to enter and
remain upon a racecourse on payment of the usual fee (Heatley v. Tasmanian
Racing (etc) Commission (78). That there are three categories is made clear in
R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex p. Brent L.B.C. (79), in the
first, there is a decision which takes away some existing right or position ;
the second at the other extreme, covers the " application cases ', where a
decision

187

merely refuses to grant an applicant the right or position which he seeks, and
there is no duty to grant a hearing ; the third differs from the second only
in that the applicant has some legitimate expectation, arising from what has
already happened, that his application will be granted. Such " expectations "
can arise from pronouncements or undertakings of the authority concerned :
A.G. of Hong Kong v. Nq Yuen Shiu (80), at 350 ; or from a general practice :
O' Reilly v. Mackman, (81) ; Civil Service Unions case (82), Cinnamond v.
British Airports Authority (83), which the Respondents relied on strongly, was
not in the first category, but was an " application " case. In deciding that
it fell into the second category, and not the third, the court took into
account what had already happened : extensive previous misconduct, namely a
long record of convictions, with large unpaid fines. What is more, in that
case the order was not final, but was more like an indefinite suspension,
which would have been lifted on giving satisfactory undertakings as to future
good behaviour ; hence no real prejudice was suffered. In view of what had
already happened, there was no legitimate expectation.

"Useless formality " : The Respondents also relied heavily on Malloch v.
Aberdeen Corporation (84). That concerned an office held at pleasure, and
ordinarily there would not have been a right to be heard before dismissal.
However, by a 3 to 2 majority the appellant was held entitled to a hearing
because the statute forbade dismissal without " due deliberation " and
invalidated a dismissal unless three weeks notice had been given to the
office-holder of the meeting to consider dismissal. Lord Reid agreed that it
might be a good defence if it could be clearly demonstrated that hearing " the
appellant before dismissing him would have been a useless formality because
whatever he might have said could have made no difference ''; but there was a
substantial possibility that a sufficient number of the committee might have
been persuaded not to vote for dismissal ; the appellant might have argued
that the regulation in question did not require the committee to dismiss him,
or that it was ultra vires; he said that the validity of the regulation was
not obvious ; and he thought the appellant had at least an arguable case (p
1283). It is Lord Wilberforce's observation that the Respondents' stress:

188

" The appellant has first to show that his position was such that he had, in
principle, a right to make representations before a decision against him was
taken. But to show this is not necessarily enough, unless he can also show
that if admitted to state his case he had a case of substance to make. A
breach of procedure, whether called a failure of natural justice, or an
essential administrative fault, cannot give him a remedy in the courts, unless
behind there is something of substance which has been lost by the failure. The
court does not act in vain." (p. 1294)

Having said that, Lord Wilberforce considered whether the first requirement
was satisfied ; and held that there was a right to a hearing. He then said

" Then was there anything he could usefully have said, if a hearing had been
given? The reason for his dismissal was stated: it is, to say no more,
controversial. My noble and learned friend Lord Reid, has dealt with this
matter and I am happy to accept his conclusion, for the reasons he has
developed, that at least on two points - the validity of the regulations and
the construction of [regulation 4(2)]......... there were genuine contentions
to be made." (p. 1297)

The Petitioners contend that the Respondents must show that a hearing would
have been a " useless formality "; the Respondents reply that it is for the
Petitioners to show " a case of substance ". I do not regard Lord
Wilberforce's dictum as casting a burden on the Petitioners ; and certainly
not the burden of establishing a probable case. Once the petitioner brings
himself prima facie within the scope of the audi alteram partem rule. It is
for the respondent to establish circumstances which would nevertheless deny
him its protection. Lord Wilberforce expressly adopted Lord Reid's conclusion
and reasons, and, with respect, it appears to me that what he meant by " a
case of substance,' was no more than what he later called " a genuine
contention ", or what Lord Reid termed " an arguable case ". If a petitioner
shows he has an arguable case, then the respondent has failed to show that an
antecedent hearing would have been an useless formality, which would have made
no difference; he may prove more, that he had a weighty case, but this he is
not bound to do. Lord Simon agreed with Lord Reid, and added:

189

" It is unnecessary to determine whether the normal effect of a failure to
proceed in accordance with natural justice by according a hearing before
dismissal - namely, that the proceedings are a nullity - might be obviated
were it is shown that such hearing could only be a useless formality - either
because the employer had no discretion save to dismiss, or because there was
nothing that the employer could say against dismissal. That is not the present
case." (p 1298)

Of some relevance to the present case is his observation that the appellant "
might have swayed [the committee] by arguments based on general educational
policy which he sought to urge before us, but which we were in no position to
weigh." Whether the right to a hearing exists is not to be determined by
asking, after the event, what kind of case might have been made out. That
there was no case at all is a fact relevant only to the logically and
chronologically distinct issue, whether the usual consequences of non-
compliance with the audi alteram partem rule should follow.

Ex. p. Brent made the distinction clear beyond doubt ; the court held that it
would be wrong to speculate how the authority would have exercised his
discretion if he had heard the representations ; it was unrealistic not to
accept that it was certainly probable that the authority would nevertheless
have made the same decision (adhering to a declared policy) ; yet there was
material to suggest that the authority might have been under some
misapprehension. But the court was not satisfied that the authority would
inevitably have made the same decision, and Certiorari was granted to quash
the decision. In _Maradana Mosque v. Mahmud_ (85), the Privy Council did not
come to a finding that a substantial case had been made out the appellant had
placed some material and it was considered unnecessary to decide whether it
could be a valid answer to say that he had in truth no defence if given a
hearing.

" No injustice " or " no real prejudice " : This is related to the " useless
formality " principle, although the stress seems to be more on the penalty
rather than the decision. Blynn v. Keele University, was invoked to support
the contention that the denial of a hearing caused no injustice. The Court did
not hold that because there was no injustice, there was no duty to give a
hearing, but, in the exercise of its discretion, refused to grant relief in
respect of the denial of

190

natural justice. Certain undergraduates had appeared naked in the campus. By
30th June 1970, the Vice-Chancellor had clear and reliable evidence that the
plaintiff was one of the offenders ; term ended that day, and some of the
offenders were graduating on 1st July, whereupon they would no longer be
subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the University ; holding an
inquiry would then have become futile in regard to them. He could have
punished them summarily, and granted a hearing to the others, but in order to
treat all offenders equally, he decided to exercise his disciplinary powers
summarily, and to give them all a right of appeal to the University Council.
Accordingly, he excluded the plaintiff from residence on the campus for one
year, and imposed a fine of ten pounds. The plaintiff appealed to the Council
(justifying his harmless " sunbathing ", and deploring the " proven
psychologically harmful aftermath of Victorian prudishness ") ; on 10th August
the Council notified him that his appeal was fixed for 2nd September. The
plaintiff had gone abroad, but his mother acknowledged the letter, and stated
her own views. He was absent and unrepresented, when his appeal was taken up,
and it was dismissed. It was held that the Vice-Chancellor was acting in a
quasi-judicial capacity (and not in a " magisterial " capacity or in a matter
of internal discipline) ; that he was bound to comply with natural justice.
However the plaintiff was refused relief in the exercise of a discretion which
" should be very sparingly exercised "; the facts were not in dispute, the
offence merited a severe penalty, the penalty imposed was appropriate, and had
he been heard, all that he could have done would have been to plead in
mitigation. While not disregarding the importance of such a plea in an
appropriate case, the deprivation of that opportunity was not considered
sufficient to set aside a decision which was intrinsically a perfectly proper
one. That decision cannot apply where the charge is not clear, or defence is
imposed, especially where mitigation is not obviously out of the question.

I must not fail to mention that the Privy Council, in Annamumthodo (at p.
625), rejected the suggestion " that a man. could not complain of a failure of
natural justice unless he could show that he had been prejudiced by it
............. It is a prejudice to any man to be denied justice. He will not,
of course, be entitled to damages if he suffered none. But he can always ask
for the decision against him to be set aside."

191

" Urgency " : Learned President's Counsel for the Respondents submitted that
the need to take prompt action justified the denial of a hearing. The
Petitioners after signing the notice of resolution commenced a campaign
against the Executive Presidential system and the President, couched in
unrestrained language and accompanied by the widest possible publicity. The
unity, stability and cohesiveness of the Party was threatened. Urgent action
was necessary. After expulsion the Petitioners intensified their campaign, and
this confirmed that prompt action was vital (but such subsequent conduct may
equally be attributable to resentment engendered by denial of natural
justice). Reliance was placed on Glynn as well as Gaiman v. National
Association for Mental Health (86). In Glynn, there was absolute urgency : had
the Vice-Chancellor waited one day more, some of the offenders would have been
outside jurisdiction. The penalty was not grave, and a right of appeal was
expressly reserved the plaintiff failed to avail himself of it. The punishment
imposed on the Petitioners was the maximum ; once communicated to Parliament
the decision was probably irrevocable ; there: was no provision for internal
review or reconsideration. It may be that Working Committee justifiably felt
that the Petitioners were seeking to tie up the matter in the courts
indefinitely, by improperly instituting the District Court actions ; it is
arguable that the effect of Article 99 (13) (a) is to exclude injunctive
relief. Those considerations would have justified not delaying a decision
beyond Monday morning. Where urgent action is required, the action taken must
not be more precipitate than the circumstances require. Socrates was given a
hearing before he was condemned, but pleaded with his judges

" I cannot convince you, the time has been too short ; if there were a law at
Athens as there is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided
in one day, then I believe that I should have convinced you. But I cannot in a
moment .........."

Surely the Petitioners could have been given one day, in a capital cause? Time
till Sunday to show cause, may be in writing, thus enabling the Working
Committee to take a decision on Sunday evening or early Monday morning.
Greater urgency than that has not been established. Gaiman does not help the
Respondents. It dealt with the expulsion of members of a Company limited by
guarantee, by a decision of the council of management. The point in issue was
whether the council had exercised the power to expel members acting

192

bona fide in what it believed to be in the interests of the company; in the
exercise of that power the council might have to act at short notice, without
hearing those affected, but this did not constitute an abuse of power. It was
expressly held that the principles of natural justice did not apply to the
expulsion of members, and the court did not decide that urgency superseded
natural justice. .

" Discretion " : The Respondent's also contended that the court has a
discretion to refuse relief, despite a denial of natural justice. I have
already dealt with the circumstances in which that discretion was very
sparingly exercised in Glynn, which is completely distinguishable. Learned
President's Counsel referred to a passage in Gaiman (at p. 381) where Megarry,
J., having held that natural justice does not apply, says " If I am wrong in
that, then I consider that the injunctions should be refused as a matter of
discretion ". His reasons are clear : the plaintiff had not shown a strong
prima facie case for the existence of the right claimed, nor did the balance
of convenience lie in favour of granting the injunctions. These are
considerations relevant to interlocutory injunctions, and that indeed - and
that alone - was what Megarry, J., was dealing with. That dictum therefore has
no application when, as now, a final order has to be made. Secretary of State
for Trade v. Hoffman-La Roche (87), was also cited. That too dealt with an
interlocutory injunction, sought in proceedings to enforce a statutory order
(pursuant to a report of the Monopolies Commission), which had been approved
by Parliament. It was contended that the Monopolies Commission acted contrary
to the rules of natural justice. Even if this be assumed, said Lord Denning,
M.R., its report was not void, and

" .........it is within the discretion of the court whether to grant him such
a remedy or not. He may be debarred from relief if he has acquiesced in the
invalidity or has waived it. If he does not come with due diligence and ask
for it to be set aside, he may be sent away with nothing : see R. v. Senate of
the University of Aston, ex parte Roffey. If his conduct has been disgraceful
and if he has in fact suffered no injustice, he may be refused relief : see
Glynn v. Keele University : Ward v. Bradford Corporation(88). If it is a
decision or order or report which affects many other persons besides him, the
court may not think it right to declare it invalid at his instance alone
.........."

193

He did not think that it would be open to the court, even at the end of the
trial, to declare invalid a statutory order approved by Parliament. That
decision is therefore inapplicable to the case with which we are concerned.

"Subsequent hearing is enough ": It was then contended that since the
Petitioners were entitled to canvass their expulsion in proceedings under
Article 99 (13) (a), firstly, the denial of a hearing did not matter, and
secondly, even the right to a hearing was excluded. Reliance was placed on De
Simith, Judicial Review of Adminstrative Action (4th ed, 1980, pp 193-194):

Can the absence of a hearing before a decision is made be adequately
compensated for by a hearing ex post facto ? A prior hearing may be better
than a subsequent hearing, but a subsequent hearing is better than no hearing
at all ; and in some cases the courts have held that statutory provisions for
an administrative appeal or even full judicial review on the merits are
sufficient to negative the existence of any implied duty to hear before the
original is made. This approach may be acceptable where the original decision
does not cause serious detriment to the person affected, or where there is
also a paramount need for prompt action, or where it is impracticable to
afford antecedent hearings
....................................................................................
If, of course, the initial decision is only provisional in the sense that it
does not take effect at all until a prescribed period for lodging objections
has expired, the opportunities thus afforded to a person aggrieved are in
substance a right to an antecedent hearing."

The learned author does not express unqualified approval of any such judicial
approach ; he considers only that it " may be acceptable " in three situations
: no serious detriment, urgency, and impracticability. Those are some of the
exceptional situations which I have just considered, and they do not exist
here. He sets out a further proviso : statutory provisions must exist for
either an administrative appeal or full judicial review on the merits. That
seems to me to refer to an integrated statutory scheme, covering both the
original decision and the appellate proceedings ; not to situations where
review or appeal is by reason of some independent provision. This is made
clear elsewhere:

**194**

" Whether a decision vitiated by a breach of the rules of natural justice can
be made good by a subsequent hearing does not admit of a single answer
applicable to all situations in which the issue may arise. Whilst it is
difficult to reconcile all the relevant cases, recent case-law indicates that
the courts are increasingly favouring an approach based in large part on an
assessment of whether, in a particular context, the procedure as a whole gave
the individual an opportunity for a fair hearing, Thus, when a provision is
made by statute or by the rules of a voluntary association for a full re-
hearing of the case by the original body (constituted differently where
possible) or by some other body vested with and exercising original
jurisdiction, a court may readily conclude that a full and fair hearing will
cure any defect in the original decision ............." (pp 242-243)

Wade makes the following observations in regard to the same question:

" Whether a hearing given on appeal is an acceptable substitute for a hearing
not given, or not properly given, before the initial decision is in some cases
an arguable question. In principle there ought to be an observance of natural
justice equally at both stages ; and accordingly natural justice is violated
if the true charge is put forward only at the appeal stage. If natural justice
is violated at the first stage, the right of appeal is not so much a true
right of appeal as a corrected initial hearing : instead of fair trial
followed by appeal, the procedure is reduced to unfair trial followed by fair
trial. This was pointed out by Megarry, J., in a trade union expulsion case,
holding that, as a general rule, a failure of natural justice in the trial
body cannot be cured by a sufficiency of natural justice in the appellate body
..............................

According to the Privy Council, however, Megarry, J. 's 'general rule' was too
broadly stated, since in some cases members of organisations, whose rights
depend upon contract, should be taken to have agreed to accept what in the end
is a fair decision, notwithstanding some initial defect. An appeal to the
committee of the Australian Jockey Club was held, for this reason, to cure an
initial decision of the stewards which failed to observe the principles of
natural justice in disqualifying the owner of a horse found to have been raced
improperly ................................

195

In the case of a public authority acting under statutory powers it would seem
paradoxical to interpret the provision of a right of appeal as meaning that
the initial decision may be any less fair than it would have to be if not
subject to appeal. In Ridge v. Baldwin the House of Lords did not allow the
chief constable's unsuccessful administrative appeal to the Home Secretary to
prejudice his right to a fair hearing before the watch committee. Nor does a
full hearing on appeal justify cancellation of a taxidriver's licence or
dismissal of a school-teacher without an initial hearing. Nevertheless it is
always possible that some statutory scheme may imply that the 'appeal' is to
be the only hearing necessary. And an appeal may have greater curative effect
where the appeal tribunal has original as well as appellate jurisdiction." (pp
487-489)

The following are the principles which seem to me to be applicable. If an
order is " provisional ", and is subject to appeal or objection, antecedent
hearing is probably not necessary. If it is final, but by statute or contract
there is provision (a) for a "full re-hearing ' by the same or another body
having original jurisdiction, or (b) making the decision and an appeal against
it (especially if it is by way of " full re-hearing ") part of an integral
scheme, it may be that an initial hearing is dispensed with, or that the
absence thereof is not fatal. Where the re-hearing is appellate in nature,
even if it has been partially successful (as in Ridge v. Baldwin) it will
seldom cure the initial defect ; particularly where the initial error is grave
and the decision has serious consequences for the individual. It is vital that
the procedure as a whole must give the individual an opportunity for a fair
hearing. What has been said above about " re-hearing " and " appeals " does
not apply at all to applications for judicial review or proceedings under
Article 99 (13) (a). The fact that Certiorari lies in respect of a decision
can never be a circumstance which will dispense with the need for an
antecedent hearing. The anomalies inherent in the Respondents' contention can
be illustrated : if disciplinary proceedings are taken against two Party
members - one a Member of Parliament, the other not - it can never be that an
antecedent hearing is required for the latter, but not for the former, simply
because of Article 99 (13) (a). Further the proceedings before us cannot in
any way be considered a " re-hearing ", let alone a " full re-hearing ".
Procedural and time constraints prevented a full investigation by this Court.
The precise charges relied on by the

196

Respondents became clear only in the course of their Counsel's reply, and it
was only then that the question of the adequacy of the Petitioners'
explanation for the lack of internal discussion could be properly appreciated.
Had we to determine, by way of a " full rehearing ", matters such as Party
policy as to the system of government, the relevant documents (decisions of
Party Convention, Manifestos, etc) would have become necessary. I therefore
hold that the Constitutional remedy under Article 99 (13) (a) does not relieve
the Party of the duty to afford an antecedent hearing in disciplinary matters,
and does not cure the lack of a hearing.

" No evidence " : Finally learned President's Counsel for the Respondents
submitted that the Petitioners had not indicated what facts they would have
placed before the Working Committee had they been given a hearing. This is
perhaps another aspect of the "useless formality " or " open and shut case "
principle, namely that if the party aggrieved does not adequately indicate to
the Court what factual or legal matters he could have relied on, then the
Court will more readily hold that a hearing would have made no difference. I
will assume that this is right. It was only in their counter-affidavits that
the Petitioners alleged " that there did not exist a degree of freedom
necessary to raise questions which would involve a curtailment of Presidential
power ", and they gave no particulars. I have already noted that the ambiguity
in the allegations may have somewhat obscured the need for such explanation ;
the reference to the failure to initiate internal discussions could
legitimately have been regarded as an aggravating feature of the offence, and
not as an independent charge : Annamunthodo is an instance of such ambiguity.
If so, a successful defence in respect of the main charge would result in an
acquittal in respect of the aggravated charge as well. That apart, there is
material on record. The Petitioners averred that the Party Manifesto of 1989
referred to the proposed restructuring of political systems and relationships
including an enhanced role for Parliament ; that in October 1989, at the All
Party Conference ("A.P.C.') a proposal was made by the S.L.F.P. that the
Executive Presidential system be abolished, and that it was thereupon agreed
(subject to further consultations by all Parties) to consider Referendum being
held once peace and normalcy was restored to decide on the acceptability of
the Presidential system ; according to the Respondents this was not pursued by
the A.P.C. as the S.LF.P. stopped attending the Conference shortly thereafter.
A newspaper report produced by the

197

Respondents contains a claim by Mr. Gamini Dissanayake that in 1989, to the
knowledge of the President, he had advocated the abolition of the Executive
Presidential system ; this was not denied. There was another report of a
statement by Mr. Athulathmudali that this question arose within the Party
Youth League, and that they had often to give answers to Youth League members
; what exactly this means is not clear. Yet another report produced by the
Respondents was to the effect that Mr. G. M. Premachanda had lobbied in the
Cabinet to remove certain Emergency Regulations and that this met with
vehement opposition from another Minister. Bearing in mind that the
Petitioners had only three or four days to reply to the Respondents' statement
of objections I am of the view that the ground on which the Petitioners would
have relied was stated, and that there is material before this Court relevant
to that ground. The position in regard to the charge of deceiving the Cabinet
is considered separately.

Resulting position : Let me now examine the position in regard to all the
charges; apart from that affecting only Messrs Premachandra and
Athulathmudali. The Respondents' position is that signing the notice of
resolution and seeking the abolition of the Executive Presidential system are
not relied on to justify the expulsions ; the charge of insult and injury to
the President is not mentioned, even indirectly, in the 2nd Respondent's
address to the Working Committee, and as I have already indicated it is
difficult to understand how the Working Committee came to a decision on that
charge. Thus out of four charges only one remains : the failure to initiate
internal discussions. The Petitioners could have tendered an explanation ; it
may well be that the Working Committee could probably have reached the same
decision, but I cannot say that they would inevitably have done so. As Wade
points out, (p 477) a distinction might be made, justifying the disregard of
natural justice in the case of a tribunal required to decide according to law,
where the demerits of the claim are such that it would be struck out in legal
proceedings as being an abuse of the process of the court; but in the case of
a discretionary administrative decision hearing the case can soften the heart
of the authority so as to reduce the penalty even though it is clear from the
outset that punitive action was justified. I hold that a hearing would not
have been a useless hearing and that grave prejudice was caused by the denial
of a hearing. There being no exceptional circumstances, the decision would
have had to be declared void ab inito had these

198

been proceedings for judicial review simpliciter, where that Court is
concerned with observance of procedure, rather than with the substance of the
decision. As observed in Chief Constable (North Wales) v. Evans

"......... the purpose of the remedies is to ensure that the individual is
given fair treatment by the authority to which he has been subjected and that
it is no part of that purpose to substitute the opinion of the judiciary or of
individual Judges for that of the authority constituted by law to decide the
matters in question. The function of the court is to see that lawful authority
is not abused by unfair treatment and not to attempt itself the task entrusted
to that authority by the law." (p 143)

" judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision-
making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed,
the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power,
be itself guilty of usurping power ............. [It] is not an appeal from a
decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made." (pp
154-155)

Our jurisdiction under Article 99(13) (a) is not a form of judicial review, or
even of appeal, but rather an original jurisdiction analogous to an action for
a declaration, though it is clearly not a re-hearing. Are we concerned only
with the decision-making process, or must we also look at the decision itself?
Article 99 (13) (a) requires us to decide whether the expulsion was valid or
invalid, some consideration of the merits is obviously required. In Climes v.
Grand Junction Canal (84), decrees entered by the Vice-Chancellor had been
affirmed by the Lord Chancellor, who owned shares in the company. On appeal to
the House of Lords the Lord Chancellor's order was set aside (although " no
one can suppose that [he] would be, in the remotest degree, influenced by
[that] interest ") ; but the House of Lords then dealt with the appeal on the
merits, and affirmed the original decrees of the Vice-Chancellor. Had these
proceedings been purely by way of judicial review, it may well be that we
would have to shut our eyes to the merits of the decision, and look only at
the defects in the decision-making process. But it is accepted that our
jurisdiction is not restricted. The burden, if any, must be on the
Respondents, for it is the denial of natural justice by them which has
resulted in these proceedings. I have therefore to consider whether

199

on the merits the Respondents have shown that the decision was a good one,
thereby disentitling the Petitioners to relief. The following matters compel
me to hold that the Respondents have failed to justify the expulsions :

(i) It became clear that the failure to initiate prior internal discussions
was a distinct charge only midway through the legal arguments ;

(ii) although the fact that the Petitioners took no steps to initiate such
discussions is undisputed, they have stated the general nature of the
explanation which they would have offered ; and there is some material to
support it ; that explanation might have been rejected after full inquiry, but
it was the defective nature of the proceedings and resolution of the Working
Committee which was the main reason for this matter not being fully dealt with
in the pleadings and submissions before us ; and

(iii) even if that explanation was rejected, it was relevant to a plea of
mitigation, and it cannot be said that this was not an appropriate case for
mitigation.

I therefore hold that the expulsion of the Petitioners in S. C. (Special) Nos
4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11/91 was invalid ; this will not preclude fresh
disciplinary proceedings on the same or different charges. While this would
normally have applied to the other two Petitioners (in S.C. (Special) Nos 5
and 8/91) as well, I hold their expulsion to be valid for reasons which I set
out below.

The case against Messrs Premachandra and Athulathmudali : I have now to
consider the allegation against Messrs Premachandra and Athulathmudali that
they misled and deceived the Cabinet on 28.8.91. Learned President's Counsel
submitted on their behalf that secrecy was necessary during the period when
the requisite signatures were being collected. I will assume that secrecy was
justified upto 27.8.91, when the notice was received by the Speaker ; or even
right upto the time on 28.8.91 when the President was informed by the Speaker
that he had entertained the notice. Thereafter disclosure could not have
caused any prejudice to the notice of resolution. It is not clear when these
two Petitioners signed. The material before us suggests that it is possible
that they signed

200

after the Speaker had written to the President : but that would be in itself
extremely grave misconduct ; and it would not in any way mitigate their
conduct on the 28th, for it would strain one's credulity to assume that on
28.8.91 they had not made up their minds to sign, and decided to do so only
after the vote of confidence. I will take, in their favour, the more lenient
view, that they signed before the Speaker received the notice. When, as
Ministers, they joined in a vote of confidence in the President at the Cabinet
meeting on 28.8.91 they thereby represented to the President, and to the
Cabinet collectively, that they were not associated with the notice, and that
they did not consider that there was justification for presenting a resolution
for removal. But how could they possibly have had confidence in a man whose
removal from office they actively desired ? Even to a person who knew that
they had previously signed the notice, their conduct amounted to an assertion
that they had changed their minds, and were no longer of the opinion that such
a resolution should be supported. They lied to the Cabinet, and deceived the
Cabinet. The Cabinet is charged with the direction and control of the
government, and operates on the basis of collective responsibility. Deception
completely undermines loyalty, trust and confidence, vital for its
functioning.

Members of democratic institutions owe a duty to be frank and candid with
their colleagues and the public. Secrecy and deception are not conducive to
the working of such institutions, whose affairs must be characterized by
openness, honesty and fair disclosure. Thus judges function in open court ;
people know what they decide, and why, and if they disagree, why they
disagree, and what each has decided. Proceedings in Parliament too are
generally open to the public ; secret or unpublished laws and regulations are
anathema to a democratic society. In regard to the executive government too,
there is a growing global trend towards recognition of the citizen's right to
freedom of information. Democracy is not furthered by practising economy with
the truth, but rather by full disclosure : the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, subject to statutory provisions for confidentiality in
the public interest. A Member of Parliament who lies to or otherwise deceives
Parliament is guilty of a serious breach of privilege

201

" The House may treat the making of a deliberately misleading statement as a
contempt.

In 1963 the House resolved that in making a personal statement, which
contained words which he later admitted not to be true, a former Member had
been guilty of a grave contempt (profumo's Case CJ (1962-63) 246). " (Erskine
May, 20th ed, 1983, p. 149)

No lesser standard can be accepted for a Minister in relation to the Cabinet
and Cabinet proceedings. It may be that our society no longer expects high
standards from politicians or holders of public office ; that politics is
considered to be a dirty game, characterized by intimidation, bribery, false
promises and deception. May be ; may be not. Democratic institutions cannot
accept or acquiesce in such views. The courts certainly must not give their
blessings to such norms of conduct, especially in the case of high officers,
and in that context it is relevant that the State accords to Ministers
precedence even over Judges of this Court. How then can we lower the norms
applicable to Ministers?

In their pleadings the Petitioners gave no explanation at all for their
conduct, although in regard to the other charge they alleged that the climate
was not conducive to free speech and dissent. Learned President's Counsel
submitted on their behalf that they might have given half a dozen explanations
had they been asked. He ventured to suggest that premature disclosure was
avoided on account of apprehensions about the personal safety of themselves
and members of their family. This is unacceptable in the absence of even a
suggestion as to the nature and source of any anticipated threat, and nothing
but a serious threat would have sufficed. It is also implausible, since they
felt able to disclose their role within a day or two. He also submitted that
disclosure might have prejudiced the ultimate passing of the resolution ; not
only is this highly speculative, but it proceeds upon the assumption that
action intended to ensure purity at the highest levels of executive government
can itself be founded upon deception and falsehood. Deception may have been
politic or expedient, but it was neither right nor honourable. In the result I
find that -

202

(i) the charge was clear and unambiguous from the inception;

(ii) the facts are undisputed ; the only uncertainty lies in the possibility
that these two Petitioners may have signed the notice of resolution after it
was delivered to the Speaker, which in my view would aggravate rather than
mitigate their conduct ;

(iii) no explanation has been offered in their affidavits, nor is one to be
found in the documents produced ; the explanations suggested by Counsel in his
submissions are speculative ; accordingly, an antecedent hearing would have
made no difference'; and

(iv) the misconduct was grave, and expulsion was intrinsically a perfectly
proper penalty.

I hold that the expulsion of the Petitioners in S.C. (Special) Nos. 5 and 8/91
was valid.

**7\. BREACH OF NATURAL JUSTICE: (b) bias**

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the proceedings and order of the
Working Committee were vitiated by bias, in that -

(i) The President was present and presided at the meetings of the Disciplinary
Committee and of the Working Committee, although he did not participate in the
discussions, recommendation and decision ; he had an " interest " in the issue
as the notice of resolution was directed at him.

(ii) The eleven members of the Disciplinary Committee were present and
actively participated in the proceedings and decision of the Working Committee
; since they had recommended expulsion, they should not have participated.

(iii) The 2nd Respondent, the General Secretary of the Party, had been named a
defendant in the District Court proceedings, had been present in the District
Court, had participated in the proceedings of the Disciplinary Committee, and
presented the case against the Petitioners to the Working Committee, virtually
as the prosecutor ; he should not have participated in the proceedings and
decision of the Working Committee.

203

There has been controversy as to the precise formulation of this rule against
bias. Thus Lord Hewart's celebrated dictum in R. v. Sussex Justices (90),
seems to suggest that those who decide must, like Caesar's wife, be above
suspicion

" Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an
improper interference with the course of justice."

In Cooper v. Wilson, it was said

" The risk that a respondent may influence the Court is so abhorrent
.............. that the possibility of it or even the appearance of such a
possibility is sufficient to deprive the decision of all judicial force, and
to render it a nullity."

The same notion appears in the headnote in Uannam v. _Bradford City Council_
(91). In _Eckersley v. Mersey Docks and Harbour Board_ (92) , it was said that
judges of all kinds must be free from even unreasonable suspicion of bias. The
better view however is that mere suspicion or possibility of bias is not
enough. It is settled that actual bias need not be proved. Two tests vie for
acceptance, was there a real likelihood of bias? ( _R. v. Essex Justices_
(93), _R. V. Cambome Justices_ (94), R. v. Nailsworth Justices (95), R. v.
Barnsley (etc) Justices (96), Simon v. Commissioner of National Housing (97)).
Or would a reasonable person reasonably suspect that the tribunal might be
biased ? (Law v. Chartered Institute of Patent Agents (98), Metropolitan
Properties v. Lannon (99)). Sometimes these two tests are interwoven as if
they were one

"...................if right minded persons would think that, in the
circumstances, there was a real likelihood of bias on his part, then he should
not sit.......... Nevertheless there must appear to be a real likelihood of
bias. Surmise or conjecture is not enough. There must be circumstances from
which a reasonable man would think it likely or probable that [he] would, or
did, favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other." (Lannon, at p 310)

" If a reasonable person who has no knowledge of the matter beyond knowledge
of the relationship which subsists between some members of the tribunal and
one of the parties would think that there might well be bias, then there is in
his opinion a real likelihood of bias " (Hannam at p 700)

204

It has also been suggested that both tests produce virtually the same result
(Hannam, at p 694). On the other hand it has also been pointed out that
sometimes the two tests lead to different results (R. v. Barnsley Justices ;
and as in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal).

It seems to me that the test of bias has an objective as well as a subjective
element. Apart from what a person legitimately interested in the matter may
actually think, if there are circumstances which in the opinion of the court
would lead a reasonable man to think it likely or probable that the
adjudicator would or did favour one side unfairly, then the test is satisfied
; it does not matter (as in Dimes) that no one actually did think so ; and
those circumstances need not have been known to the person concerned. The
subjective element is that even if in those circumstances the court would not
form that opinion, it may be that the objector knew only some of those
circumstances ; if with such limited knowledge (as in R. v. Sussex Justices)
he would reasonably think the adjudicator would or did favour the other side
unfairly, then too the test is satisfied.

The authorities cited fall into distinct categories. The first group relates
to instances of actual or apparent participation in the deliberations of the
deciding body, by complete " outsiders " (e.g. an " observer " in R. v.
Leicestershire Fire Authority (100), a witness in R. v. _Bodmin Justices_
(101) or a party (e.g. Cooper v. Wilson ; R. v. Surrey Assessment Committee
(102) or even its own officer (e.g. its clerk : R. v. Sussex Justices, R. v.
Essex Justices).

The next group of cases deals with the conduct of the adjudicators. The first
point to be noted is that it is proper for a numerically large tribunal to
authorise a small sub-committee drawn from its own membership to make
preliminary investigations and recommendations, provided that the ultimate
decision is by the main body. This is the effect of Queen v. L.C.C., ex p.
Akkersdyk (103), which held only that a member who had by his conduct made
himself interested, could not sit with the main body. Similarly, in Jeffs v.
N. Z. Dairy Products (etc) Board, the Privy Council did not consider it
objectionable for the members of such a sub-committee to participate in the
decision of the main body ; that decision was held to be bad only because when
the main body met, the members, other than the members of the sub-Committee,
did not have all the evidence and submissions. It seems to me that all those
who are charged with

205

the duty of adjudicating on some matter are entitled to participate in the
decision ; if some of them assist their colleagues by conducting some
preliminary investigation, it cannot be that they are thereby disabled from
performing their principal duty., (cf. also R. v. Greenwich L.B.C.)

However, if as a member of such sub-committee an adjudicator does something
whereby he makes himself interested in the proceedings, or places himself in
the position of a party or a party's advocate, then he is disqualified by
bias. In Akkersdyk, some members of a sub-committee recommended that a licence
should not be granted, retained counsel and solicitor to oppose the
application for a licence, and then participated in the proceedings ; but when
it appeared that they were both accusers and judges, they abstained from
further participation. The decision to refuse the licence was quashed. Frome
United Breweries v. Bath Justices (104), was similar.

The third category are cases of interest, involving no question of sub-
committees. In R. v. Hendon Rural District Council (105), a councillor voting
for a resolution had a disqualifying interest in the subject-matter of the
resolution ; the unanimous decision of the council was quashed. In Lannon, an
adjudicator was disqualified because he had an interest adverse to one party.
R. v. Altrincham Justices (106), was similar:

" It is enough to show that there is a real likelihood of bias, or at all
events that a reasonable person advised of the circumstances might reasonably
suspect that the judicial office was incapable of producing the (requisite]
imparliality and detachment."

In Hannam, an adjudicator was a member of the body whose decision was being
challenged, and although he had not participated in that decision he was held
to be interested as he was an integral part of the body whose action was being
impugned. In Roebuck v. National Union of Mineworkers (107), this president of
the union successfully brought a libel action, on behalf of the union, against
a newspaper. The members of the union gave evidence for the newspaper; one
contradicted a written statement made to the union's solicitors, and the other
showed the newspaper official correspondence. The executive committee of the
union expelled the two members ; the president look an active part in the
proceedings, but

206

did not vote. It was held that it was no answer to say that he did not
influence the result. The expulsion was quashed.

There is no question here of participation by outsiders. Clearly the
participation of the members of the Disciplinary Committee in the decision to
expel was not improper. None of the authorities in the second category are
applicable. The 2nd Respondent participated more actively, and this is
understandable as he was the General Secretary. But none of the members made
themselves accusers or prosecutors, or did more than carry out their
legitimate functions in regard to a preliminary investigation. The presence of
the President does not make this case comparable to Roebuck, because he did
not participate at all in the proceedings. Superficially, his presence appears
to fail within the first category, but all those were instances in which an
impression was created in the mind of the party complaining that an interested
person had participated in the deliberations. Here no such impression was
created, because the Petitioners were not there ; and they do not complain in
their petitions of any such impression. In other words, neither the objective
nor the subjective element in the test of bias is satisfied. It was submitted
that the mere presence of the President would have been a dominating influence
; that would probably be true of practically every leader of almost any
political party in Sri Lanka since independence. It is idle to think that his
absence would have diminished his influence. In any event, the test of bias
cannot be applied as strictly as in judicial proceedings, for here all members
of the tribunal would inevitably have had views, and possibly strong views, on
the matters in issue (see the Bromley L.B.C. case, at pp 131-2, for an
instance where the court might be considered " interested ", but yet not
disqualified). Had the " dissidents " been in a majority, if the question of
disciplinary action against the " orthodox " minority had arisen, I doubt
whether the tribunal could be regarded as biased simply because it consisted
of the " dissident " majority. Although the principle against bias does apply,
this serves to illustrate the difficulty of applying that principle to a
situation in which there is no lis between two contesting parties. I hold that
the mere presence of the President did not vitiate the decision. It must be
noted that in any event the President could not be regarded as having a
disqualifying interest in relation to the charge of deceiving the Cabinet and
on the merits, I consider that charge to have been established. Further, in
view of my findings regarding denial of natural justice in

207

respect of the failure to initiate internal discussions, it is not strictly
necessary for me to consider the issue of bias. ****

**8\. CONCLUSION**

I am deeply appreciative of the ready co-operation and assistance extended by
Counsel to the Court in elucidating the many important issues, of rare
complexity, which arose right through these proceedings.

I direct the Registrar to expunge the matters referred to in paragraph (2) of
this judgment.

I determine that

(a) the expulsion of the Petitioners in S.C. (Special) Nos 4,6,7,9,10 and
11/91 was invalid ; and

(b) the expulsion of the Petitioners in S.C. (Special) Nos -5 and 8/91 was
valid.

I make no order as to costs.

**KULATUNGA, J.**

These Applications (Special) Nos. 4-11/91 were of consent heard together as
they involved the same issues and rested substantially on the same facts. The
petitioners are Members of Parliament and are members of the United National
Party (UNP) (the 4th respondent) which is a recognised political party within
the meaning of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981\. The 1st, 2nd
and 3rd respondents are the Chairman, General Secretary and General Treasurer
of the UNP respectively ; they are all members of the National Executive
Committee (NEC) and the Working Committee of the UNP. The 5th respondent is
the Secretary General of Parliament against whom no relief has been claimed ;
he has been joined for the purpose of giving him notice of these proceedings.

208

The petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under the Proviso
to Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution. Each of them seeks a determination
that his expulsion from the membership of the UNP communicated by the letter
dated 09.09.91 (P1) under the hand of the 2nd respondent is invalid. The
decision for the expulsion of these petitioners has been made by the Working
Committee of the UNP by its resolution dated 06.09.91 (PIA). The grounds for
such expulsion have been set out in PlA ; and the decision of the Working
Committee to expel the petitioners has been endorsed by the NEC on 07.09.91 as
evidenced by the extracts of the minutes of the NEC, marked R5.

**FACTS**

The petitioners are Members of Parliament having been elected to Parliament
from the UNP at the General Elections held in February 1989\. The petitioner
in application No. 4 held office as a Cabinet Minister until March 1990. The
petitioners in applications Nos. 5 and 8 were Cabinet Ministers and the
petitioners in applications Nos. 6 and 7 were a State Minister and a Project
Minister respectively in the government ; each of them had resigned from his
office as such Minister a few days prior to the, impugned expulsion. The
petitioners in applications Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are Members of Parliament for
the electoral districts of Kegalle, Badulla and Colombo respectively. Under
Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution the seats of these petitioners will
become vacant by reason of their expulsion from the membership of the UNP and
they will be deprived of their status as Members of Parliament unless they
obtain a determination from this Court that the impugned expulsion is invalid.

The conduct of the petitioners for which they were expelled consists of a
series of alleged acts and omissions by them in the course of a campaign
connected with an attempt by some Members of Parliament to take proceedings
under Article 38 (1) (e) read with Article 38 (2) for the removal of His
Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa from the Office of President of the Republic
of Sri Lanka. Under Rule 7 (1) of the UNP Constitution (P2) The President,
being a member of the UNP, is also the Leader of the Party. A copy of the
requisite notice of resolution given to the Speaker under Article 38 (2) (a)
has been produced marked P3B. The petitioners state that the said notice of
resolution had been signed by not less than one-half of the whole

209

number of Members of Parliament ; and that on 28.08.91 the Speaker informed
the President by writing that he had entertained the said resolution in terms
of Article 38 (2) (b) and further drew the attention of the President to
Proviso (c) to Article 70 (1).

The respondents deny that the said resolution was duly entertained by the
Speaker inasmuch as the Speaker announced in Parliament on 08.10.91 that
having inquired into the matter, he was of the view that the notice of
resolution did not have the required number of valid signatures and
accordingly it could not be proceeded with. The petitioners have joined issue
on this and reiterate that the said resolution was duly entertained ; but
those are proceedings in Parliament which this Court cannot or need not
inquire into for the purpose of determining the applications filed by the
petitioners. Reference will, therefore, be made to the said resolution only to
the extent that the contents thereof may be relevant to the question before us
namely, the validity of the impugned expulsion.

The resolution alleges the existence of all the grounds for the removal of the
President provided by Article 38 (2) (a). It alleges that the President is
guilty of -

(a) intentional violation of the Constitution and/or

(b) treason and/or

(c) bribery and/or

(d) misconduct or corruption including the abuse of the powers of his office
and/or

(e) any offence under any law involving moral turpitude.

It also alleges that the President is permanently incapable of discharging the
functions of his office by reason of mental or physical infirmity. This is
followed by a purported statement of the particulars of the allegations. From
that statement I have extracted the following items as they are relevant to a
consideration of the conduct of the petitioners outside Parliament between
28.08.91 and 06.09.91. i.e. during the period prior to their expulsion which'
conduct is evidenced by copies of news paper reports R 3A to R 3G and R 4A to
R 4L. The respondents rely inter alia, on such conduct as constituting good
grounds for the impugned expulsion. The resolution states that the President
has -

210

(1) violated several provisions of the Constitution whereby the powers of
Parliament and of Cabinet Ministers have been undermined ;

(2) given direct orders to Secretaries by-passing their Ministers;

(3) engaged Secretaries to obtain confidential reports on their Ministers ;

(4) endangered the security of the State by arming the liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and sending off the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKE)
without considering military aspects.

(5) resorted to unlawful telephone tapping including the telephones of
Ministers ;

(6) engaged in wasteful expenditure including for Gam Udawa Celebrations ;

(7) established a one man dictatorship colloquially referred to as a "one man
show."

The newspaper reports R 3A to R 3G and R 4A to R 4L which have not been denied
show that the petitioners led by the petitioners in applications Nos. 4, 5 and
8 had prior to 06.09.91 commenced a public campaign in the course of which
they had agitated every one of the matters referred to above at regular press
conferences and in statements to the media by them, and also in a speech made
by the petitioner in application No. 4 at a religious ceremony in a temple and
in a speech made by the petitioner in application No. 8 to the officers of the
Education Ministry when he went there to wind-up duties upon resignation.

One of the allegations contained in P 1 A is that on 28.08.91 after the
speaker had informed the President that he had entertained the notice of
resolution P 3B the petitioners in applications Nos. 5 and 8 joined the rest
of the members of the Cabinet in passing an unanimous vote of confidence in
the President by a show of hands individually. This has not been denied by
either of petitioners ; and the petitioner in application No. 8 has in R 3B
and R 4E admitted the event.

211

On 03.09.91, 116 members of Government Parliamentary Group presented to the
Speaker a writing dated 30.08.91 (R15) regarding the resolution for the
removal of the President stating, inter alia, as follows :

" We write to hereby inform you that we do not support the said resolution.
Those of us who have placed our signatures do hereby withdraw and revoke our
signatures and consent thereto ", and proceeded to request the Speaker not to
place the resolution on the Order Paper. On 02.09.91 the same members passed a
vote of confidence in the President (R16). This document also contains a
statement that interested parties had obtained the signatures of certain
Government and Opposition Members of Parliament through misrepresentation and
deceit.

Simultaneously with the above developments the petitioners commenced holding
of daily press conferences which were presided over by the petitioners in
applications Nos. 4, 5 and 8. At the first conference reported in the press on
01.09.91 (R 3G) which was attended by all the petitioners, they claimed to
have with them 47 UNP M.P.s. The same number is claimed in R 4C (02.09.91) and
R 4G (04.09.91). They also assured the public that the resolution will have
the support of two thirds of the Members of Parliament and claimed that more
will join them. In R 11K (06.10.91) they claimed that 44 out of the original
47 M.P.s were still with them.

On 05.09.91 the petitioners filed actions in the District Court of Colombo. In
the plaint (P4) they set out the events relating to the resolution for the
removal of the President a copy of which they annexed to the plaint and state
that they apprehend that the NEC and/or the Working Committee of the UNP would
suspend or expel them from the party particularly in view of the fact that a
meeting of the NEC had been summoned for 07.09.91 by a notice dated 05.09.91 a
copy of which they annexed to the plaint. They prayed inter alia for a
declaration that they are not liable to be so suspended or expelled and for an
enjoining order and interim and permanent injunctions in that regard. On
06.09.91 the District Judge after hearing Counsel made order (P6) refusing to
entertain the actions and refusing the enjoining orders sought by each of the
petitioners. At 7.30 p.m. on the same day the Working Committee passed the
resolution P1A

212

expelling them. On 07.09.91 the NEC attended by 2500 members endorsed the
decision of the Working Committee.

The respondents state that subsequent to their expulsion the petitioners
launched a country-wide campaign and condemned the Executive Presidential
system and the party leader; between 10.09.91 and 20.10.91 they held public
rallies for this purpose at Nugegoda, Kandy, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Badulla,
Galle, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Kiribathgoda, Puttalam and Polonnaruwa. The
petitioners do not deny this but state that these activities being subsequent
to their expulsion are irrelevant to these proceedings and have been
introduced to mislead the Court ; and further state that they did not campaign
for the abolition of the Presidential system or the reversion to the pre 1978
system. They state that the essence of their contention in public was that the
Executive Presidency should be made more accountable to Parliament and the
President's powers should be reduced.

After the Speaker ruled on 08.10.91 that the resolution for removal of the
President cannot be proceeded with, the opposition moved a motion of no
confidence in the Speaker. This was debated on 10.10.91; petitioners voted in
favour of it whilst the Government Parliamentary Group voted against it.

**GROUNDS OF EXPULSION**

The grounds of expulsion as appearing in the Working Committee resolution
(P1A) may be summarised as follows :

1\. (a) Signing the notice of resolution (P3B) together with several members
of the opposition which is an act of betrayal of the Party Membership and the
confidence placed by the people in the Party and its Leadership at successive
elections.

(b) Signing the said notice of resolution without any prior information to the
party or raising or discussing the same within the Party Organizations or the
Government Parliamentary Group.

2\. In particular the petitioners in applications Nos. 5 and 8 misled and
deceived the Cabinet of Ministers on 28.08.91 into the belief that they were
ignorant of and were not associated with

213

the notice of resolution by joining the other members of the Cabinet in
passing a vote of confidence in the President.

3\. Having been elected to Parliament as UNP M.P.s on the basis of the
Executive Presidential System and under the Leadership of the President ;

(a) engaged in a public campaign against the Executive Presidential System
which is the principle and policy of the UNP.

(b) used such campaign as a cover to cause insult and injury to the character,
integrity and ability of the Leader of the Party in his capacity as President
of the country.

4\. Doing all the aforesaid acts without first raising the said issues within
the Party Organizations or the Government Parliamentary Group as is required
by the Party Constitution and conventions.

5\. By such conduct and actions the petitioners have manifestly and flagrantly
and in disregard of Party discipline, duties and responsibilities.

(a) breached the conditions of membership of the Party ;

(b) acted contrary to the principles and policies of the Party ;

(c) repudiated and violated the Constitution and conventions of the Party ;
and

(d) brought the Party and its Leadership to disrepute and held it up to public
ridicule.

**THE UNP CONSTITUTION**

The respondents rely upon the following provisions of the UNP Constitution
(P2).

Rule 3 (1) - In accepting membership of the Party a person agrees

(a) to accept the Principles, Policy, Programme and Code of Conduct of the
Party ;

214

(b) to conform to the Constitution and Standing Orders of the Party ;

(c) not to take part in political or other activities which conflict or might
conflict with the above undertakings and not to bring the Party into
disrepute.

of the Leader of the Parliamentary Party.

(4) \- Members should take the fullest advantage of the opportunity at the
Party meetings of raising questions of Party Policy concerning which they may
have doubts.

**GROUNDS URGED AGAINST THE EXPULSION**

The petitioners challenge the expulsion on three grounds namely,

(a) absence of jurisdiction in the Working Committee ;

(b) inconsistency with the provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and
Statute Law ;

(c) breach of the rules of natural justice.

They allege that the decision to expel them is mala fide.

**ABSENCE OF JURISDICTION IN THE WORKING COMMITTEE**

The two main constituent bodies of the UNP are the Party Convention and the
National Executive Committee. The former is the largest representative body at
national level and meets regularly once a year. The latter is the
Administrative Authority of the Party at national level and consists of
approximately 2500 members. Under Rule 8 (3) it has the power, inter alia, to
take disciplinary action against any member in a manner suitable to the
circumstances of each case and mete out punishment. The Working Committee is
established by Rule 8 (3) (m) and is appointed by the Leader of the Party from
the NEC consisting of himself, Deputy Leader and all other office bearers and
any other members not exceeding fifty. The same rule confers on the Working
Committee the authority to exercise the powers and functions vested in it by
the NEC. By a resolution of the NEC dated 19.04.91 (R2) the Working Committee
has been vested with full powers to carry out the responsibilities and
functions of the NEC.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, P.C. for the petitioners strenuously contends that under
rule 8 (3) the power to take disciplinary action is vested solely in the NEC ;
that such power being judicial or quasi judicial it can be exercised by the
NEC alone ; that Rule 8 (3) (m) which provides for vesting of powers as
opposed to delegation would enable

216

the NEC to give away only its ancillary powers e.g. running of the Head
office, fund raising or propaganda ; that R2 is a wholesale divesting by the
NEC of its power vested in it by the UNP Constitution and the Working
Committee cannot exercise such power in the absence of an amendment to the
Constitution enabling the delegation of particular powers ; that R2 is outside
the contemplation of Rule 8 (3) ; that even assuming the possibility of a
delegation of powers, NEC cannot delegate its disciplinary power because Rule
8 (3) (m) is in general terms and gives no such power either expressly or by
necessary implication. Mr. de Silva cited a number of decisions including
Barnard v. National Dock Labour Board (35) ; Vine v. National Dock Labour
Board (36) and Young v. Fife Regional Council (37). The first two cases relate
to sub delegation of powers not authorised by statute. In the third case power
was delegated without any authority therefor. In Vine's case Lord Somervell
said -

" I am, however, clear that the disciplinary powers whether " judicial " or
not, cannot be delegated " (p. 951)

In Young's case it was held that the delegation was not empowered expressly or
by necessary implication and hence the decision made in virtue of delegation
is a nullity ; per Lord Ross p. 334.

Mr. de Silva further submits that the expulsion in P.1A being invalid, the NEC
could not have validated it by its endorsement R5 ; he supports this with the
decisions in Barnard's and Vine's cases (Supra) and Blackpool Corporation v.
Locker (109).

Mr. Choksy, P.C. for the respondents submits that in the cases cited by Mr. de
Silva the power had been delegated without any authority therefor or there was
held to exist an unauthorized sub-delegation of power ; here is a case where
the power to delegate is conferred expressly by Rule 8 (3) (m) ; the word
'vest' appearing therein, properly construed in the context and as appearing
in a non-statutory document, means "delegate" ; and hence the power may be
withdrawn expressly by revoking R2, and there is no abdication of power by the
NEC. He concedes that the power may even be impliedly withdrawn in the event
of NEC resuming the exercise of power see Huth v. Clerk (110). Mr. Choksy
contends that the power of delegation in Rule 8 (3) (m) is express and
unqualified and the Court cannot by interpretation limit that power ; that in
any event

217

the power given by the said rule is by necessary implication very wide and is
absolutely necessary for the proper functioning of the Party ; that it forms
part of the contract between members of the Party which cannot be avoided
unless it is contrary to public policy or the law. He argues that the
petitioners cannot seek to vary it on the ground of expediency or alleged
fraud. Answering a question by Court he said that the expulsion does not
require ratification and hence R5 was unnecessary.

Mr. Choksy points to the fact that under Standing Order 13 the NEC comprises
an unwieldly number of representatives drawn from a wide circle and includes
ex-members of Parliament and Chairman of Local Authorities who are members of
the Party and representatives of Trade Unions etc., and it is inconvenient and
impracticable for the NEC to directly exercise disciplinary powers. It
consists of 2500 members who cannot be called upon to exercise their judgment
collectively or otherwise.

Rule 8 (3) (m) requires the Leader of the Party to appoint the Working
Committee from the NEC the composition of which is fixed as follows

1\. Leader of the Party

2\. Deputy Leader

3\. All other office bearers of the NEC.,

and other members, not exceeding fifty. It is to be noted therefore that the
executive component of the NEC is included in the composition of the Working
Committee ; and the Committee itself is a microcosm " of the NEC to whom power
may be delegated even in the absence of express provision. See the dicta of
Viscount Kilmuir LC in Vine's case. Under the UNP Constitution the Working
Committee exercises not only the powers delegated to it by the NEC, but also a
variety of other powers such as -

1\. to dissolve District Balamandalayas, Polling Division Organizations or
main Associations ; Rule 2A(4)

2\. to approve the political rules of affiliated member Organizations ; Rule 3
(e)

3\. summoning of the Party Convention ; Rule 5 (a)

218

4\. appointment of Nomination Bords for elections ; Rule 9 (b)

5\. selection of a candidate for any Presidential Election ; Rule 9 (a)

6\. determination of the number of persons to be represented in the NEC among
certain categories of representatives ; Standing Order 13

7\. certain powers in respect of the UNP Youth League and UNP Women's Union ;
Standing Orders 15 and 16

8\. acquisition of property and utilization of Party funds ; Standing Order 18

9\. giving directions in the interpretation of the Constitution ; Standing
Order 21\.

All this shows that the Working Committee constitutes the core of the NEC and
functions as a body that is singularly suited to be charged with the most
vital powers and functions of the NEC including the exercise of disciplinary
power but with its roots in the larger body the members of which are spread
out country -wide.

**CONCLUSION**

Upon a consideration of the relevant authorities the submissions of Counsel
and all other matters, I am of the view that the Working Committee has been
lawfully empowered by R2 to exercise disciplinary powers over members of the
party and that there is no merit in the objection to its jurisdiction ; I
accept Mr. Choksy's submissions and hold that the Committee has jurisdiction
to take disciplinary action against the petitioners.

**INCONSISTENCY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION OF SRI LANKA AND
STATUTE LAW**

This ground of challenge relates to the lawfulness of the grounds of expulsion
set out in P1 A which I have summarised earlier in this judgment. The broad
grounds of expulsion are linked with two events namely, the signing of the
resolution P3B and the public campaign

219

against the Executive Presidential System. According to the respondents, the
said events coupled with the petitioners' conduct in failing to first raise
the issues within the Party organizations represent a repudiation of the UNP
Constitution and a flagrant breach of party displine and a cover for insulting
the character, integrity and ability of the Leader of the Party in his
capacity as President of the country which eventually brought the Party and
its Leadership to disrepute and held it up to public ridicule.

The petitioners take up the position that in respect of both events referred
to above their acts are protected by Article 4 (a) and (e) read with Article
93, 10, 14 (1) (a) and 38 of the Constitution and Section 3 of the Parliament
(Powers and Privileges) Act (Cap. 383) that the grounds of expulsion derogate
sovereignty, their freedom of thought, conscience, speech and expression and
their privileges as Members of Parliament assured by the aforesaid
constitutional and statutory provisions. They deny having repudiated the Party
Constitution and state that in any event the provisions of the Party
Constitution in particular Rules 7(3), 9(4) and 17(2) thereof relied upon for
the expulsion cannot override such protections, freedoms and privileges and
accordingly the order of expulsion is invalid. As regards the allegation that
they failed to first raise the issues within the Party organizations, they
state that there did not exist a measure of freedom to raise matters which
would involve a curtailment of Presidential powers.

Mr. de Silva, P.C. concedes the right to take disciplinary action but submits
that expulsion (which has the consequence of loss of Membership of Parliament)
cannot be effected on grounds which are contrary to the Constitution which is
the paramount law ; contractual obligations are secondary norms. 'General
Theory of Law and State' Kelsen (1961) 124, 137. Learned Counsel vehemently
contended that the grounds of expulsion are based on alleged breaches of the
provisions of the UNP Constitution which strike at the very root of the
fundamental postulates of the Constitution. He was particularly critical of
Rule 7(3) (obligation of government M.P. s to take directions from the Party
Leader or the Leader of the Parliamentary Party as to the conduct of matters
in Parliament) ; Rule 9(g) (obligation of M.P.s to conform to the principles,
policy, programme, rules and code of conduct and standing orders of the Party)
and Rule 17(2) (obligation of M.P.s to vote in Parliament according to the
Mandate of the Parliamentary Party conveyed through the Whip of the Party).

220

Dealing with the ground of expulsion based on the petitioners' conduct in
signing the notice of resolution, learned Counsel referred us to 'Theory and
Practice of Modern Government' Finer (1946) Vol. l 633-652 and submitted that
the 'free mandate' theory discussed therein and which is enshrined in some
continental Constitutions is implicit in our Constitution (Articles 4(a), (e)
and 93) ; that accordingly a member is not bound by instructions ; and he
cannot be penalised for anything done in Parliament. Signing the notice of
resolution was not a breach of the UNP Constitution ; on the contrary it was
their duty to the nation under the Constitution of the Republic to give such
notice (Article 38). Such notice is a "proceeding" in Parliament which cannot
be impeached outside the House for want of prior permission for it. The
conduct of the petitioners in having signed it is similary protected by the
provisions of Section 3 Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act ; see also,
Parliamentary Practice - Erskine May 19th Ed. 87. Counsel conceded that if the
sole motive for signing the resolution was to humiliate the Leader of the
Party and mala fide, disciplinary action is competent ; but there ought be
evidence of such motive. He also submitted that if the emphasis in the charge
against them is signing the resolution with some members of the opposition,
Article 38 is a complete answer.

As regards the campaign against the Executive Presidential System, Counsel
submitted that the Party is not irrevocably committed to continue that system
; that in any event the petitioners were not seeking to abolish but to reform
it by remedying anomalies ; that any peaceful advocacy of change is 'a
legitimate exercise of the freedoms guaranteed by Articles 10 and 14(1)(a) of
the Constitution ; that even if it were a matter of Party Policy, the party
cannot exercise an unqualified right of expulsion for contravening such policy
but should consider disciplinary action short of expulsion ; that expulsion
would be warranted only in the case of serious conduct such as bribery or
offences involving moral turpitude ; and that the campaign intended to reform
the party is permitted by the objects of the party contained in Rule 4(c) of
its Constitution namely, the promotion of the political education of the
people and their political emancipation on the basis of Democratic Socialism.
It was also submitted that the allegation that the petitioners should have
first raised these matters within the party assumes that there is a measure of
freedom within the party to raise such matters. Counsel argued that the UNP
Constitution

221

imposes a centralised system which negatives freedom ; and this is aggravated
by the provisions which enables the Leader to enjoy full power ; that matters
had reached a stage when no discussion was possible and the action taken by
the petitioners was logical and within their rights ; and that actions for
reforming the party are also legitimate even if the party were to thereby
suffer disintergration. These rights, it was submitted, cannot be comprehended
under party discipline.

Mr. de Silva P.C. cited Bromley London Borough Council v. G.L.C. (5) ; R. v
Waltham Forest L.B.C. ex p. Baxter (7) and R. v. Greenwhich L.B.C. ex p.
Lovelace & Fay (8). In the Bromley case the vires of a decision by the Council
to reduce transport fares in London by way of honouring an election pledge by
the Labour Party was successfully challenged on the ground that it imposed an
increased levy on rates on the tax payer. In Waltham Forest, a resolution of
the Council was unsuccessfully challenged on the ground that it is vitiated by
reason of certain Labour members having been pressurised to vote for it. In
Lovelace's case the question was whether a decision to reduce the number of
members of the housing committee of the Council which resulted in removing
from it certain Labour members who had voted against a proposal moved by the
majority is ultra vires the Council powers. The Court upheld the decision.
There are dicta in these cases to the effect that members are not irrevocably
bound to carry out the pre-announced policies contained in the election
manifesto, that they have a measure of freedom to decide what is immediately
in the interest of the ratepayers ; that they are not required to abdicate
their personal responsibility in favour of group policy ; and that their right
to vote cannot be fettered by a decision in the nature of a punishment.

Learned Counsel criticised the judgment in Yapa Abeywardena v. Harsha
Abeywardenea (11) wherein the view was expressed by Sharvananda, CJ that a
Member of Parliament is a mere cog in the Party wheel, that he can remain in
the party on the Party's terms and that if he fails to strictly conform to
directives or to support the Party in the House, he must resign or face
expulsion from the party. Counsel submitted that this decision should not be
followed.

Mr. Choksy, P.C. drew our attention to R1 (Minutes of the Working Committee
meeting held on 06.09.91) which contains the original resolution for the
expulsion of the petitioners and said that they have

222

been expelled from the Party not for the mere signing of the notice of
resolution under Article 38 of the Constitution or for exercising their
constitutional rights over the issue of the Executive Presidential System but
for infringing the Party Constitution, policy and discipline by their conduct,
to wit -

(a) signing the resolution together with several members of the opposition
without first raising it within the party organization; taking the allegations
to the contrary and agitating them in public ; this is a breach of Rules 3(1)
(d) and 17(6) of the UNP Constitution. Rule 3(1)(d) imposes the obligation hot
to take part in political or other activities likely to conflict with Party
Policy and the code of conduct and not to bring the party to disrepute. Rule
17(6) requires members to first raise questions of Party Policy within the
Party Organization ;

(b) breach of their pledge of loyalty to the party under Rule 17(1) and breach
of their pledge given under Rule 9(d) to act in conformity with Party Policy
and the code of conduct ;

(c) taking the issue of the Executive Presidential System to the country and
controverting it in public without first raising it within the Party
Organization in breach of Rules 3(1)(d) and 17(6) ;

(d) public campaign over both issues using uncontrolled language and making it
a cover to insult the character and integrity of the Leader of Party as the
President of the country and bringing the Party and its Leadership into
disrepute and holding it up to public ridicule, in breach of Rules 3(1)(d) and
17(1).

Mr. Choksy, P.C. proceeded to submit that assuming (but without conceding)
their right under Article 38 to sign the notice of resolution, the requirement
that the petitioners should exercise that right or their right to publicly
agitate the issue of Executive Presidential System in a manner compatible with
their obligations to the party including the maintenance of party discipline
(Rule 9(g)) is not contrary to the Constitution or other law or the
authorities cited; that the failure to first raise the issues involved within
the Party Organization is violative of a basic norm of party discipline ; that
such failure constitutes gross

223

indiscipline justifying expulsion ; and that the conduct of the petitioners in
applications Nos. 5 and 8 in deceiving the Cabinet of Ministers on 28.08.91 by
joining with the other members of Cabinet to pass a vote of confidence in the
President constitutes gross deceit. He also submitted that 'loyalty' within
the meaning of Rule 17(1) the UNP Constitution means adherence to the
Constitution and includes loyalty to the Party Leadership.

As regards Rule 7(3) which came in for heavy criticism by Mr. de Silva, Mr.
Choksy submitted that the petitioners have been expelled not for failing to
take directions from the Leader as required by the rule but for their failure
to first raise the allegations against the Leader within the Party
Organizations. He argued that one cannot assume all the members of the UNP to
be "yes" men ; that if representations are made in the appropriate manner the
members may well consider changing the Leader.

As regards the contention that there was no freedom to raise matters within
the party, Mr. Choksy argued that this is a bald statement ; there is no proof
that the petitioners had been harassed for raising any matter ; nor have they
stated that they tried to raise the issues within the party. Counsel submitted
that in the circumstances the allegation that the petitioners failed to bring
up matters within the party has not been rebutted. Counsel then conceded that
had the petitioners made any attempt to raise the issues before the party and
the party had capriciously rejected the allegations or the proposals for
reform, the petitioners would be entitled to raise the matters in public.

Mr. Choksy finally submitted that our Constitution confers primacy to the
political party as against the individual M.P.; that the party carries the
mandate of the electors and in turn gives a mandate to the M.P.. In the
circumstances, the exercise of the rights of the petitioners qua M.P.s is
subordinate to the requirements of party discipline and their freedom to
agitate matters in public is also similarly constrained by reason of their
obligations to the party which they have freely undertaken to honour.

Mr. Choksy relied on Waltham Forest L.B.C. case (Supra) in which the judgment
of Sir John Donaldson MR refers to the whip system approvingly both in
relation to local bodies and Parliament and further

224

refers to Widdicomb report which states that the Whip system is not a matter
for concern. (674) ; it also refers to circumstances in which the requirement
for consultation within the group would ensure party unity without the
councillors having to abdicate personal responsibility (676) Counsel submits
that such consultation is vital to effective government. He also cited dicta
from the decision in ex P. Lovelace (Supra) on group policy (517) and
inevitable party constraints resulting from the existence of a party line or
strategy to ensure cohesion (523). Staughton W has this to say with reference
to the off-quoted speech of Edmund Burke to the electors of Bristol in 1774

" One may doubt whether after 200 years, that is wholly in accord with the
current political wisdom " (525)

In Dissanayake v. Sri Jayawardenapura University (11) where a student
complained of the infringement by the Vice Chancellor of his rights under
Article 14(1)(a), this Court held that the right to the freedom of speech is
not absolute ; that students were bound by reasonable rules governing conduct
; and a student has the right to peacefully express his views in an
appropriate manner. Sharvananda, CJ said -

" A student may also exceed his constitutional right of speech and expression
by adopting methods of expression that materially and substantially interferes
with the Vice Chancellor's right to his reputation. For nobody can use his
freedom of speech or expression as to injure another's reputation." (267).

Mr. Choksy sought to apply this decision by analogy to M.P.s and submitted
that whilst their freedom of speech in public is constrained by the
requirements of party discipline, they also should before signing a notice of
a resolution under Article 38, first raise the matter within the party, which
is the appropriate manner of exercising the right consistently with their
obligations to the party.

Mr. Choksy said that he relies on the judgment of this Court in Abeywardena's
case (Supra) only on the principle that an M.P. owes an obligation to the
party. He argued that the theory of party system is the very soul of our
Constitution. In support of this he first cited passages from 'The Theory and
Practice of Modem Government' Finer (1946) Vol. 1632-652. He submitted that
unlike some continental

225

Constitutions our Constitution does not contain any provision that an M.P. can
vote according to his conscience ; and this is because it is based on the
political party ; that Finer himself observed at p. 641 that the factor which
today is of the most importance is the political party. At p. 646 the author
examines the effects of the proportional representation (P.R.) in Germany and
observes that the method of voting for a single representative among a number
of individual competitors was abandoned and now the mandatory is, in fact,
nobody but the party ; that the party is obliged to control the campaign and
the nominations ; and that members are bound in the first place to the
dictates of the party machine.

Mr. Choksy next referred us to the P. R. provisions contained in Article 99 of
our Constitution and to the provisions of Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of
1981 and drew our attention to the salient features of the system provided
thereunder, which are as follows :

1\. The system of electing individual members for constituencies has been
abolished.

2\. Nomination papers are submitted not by the individual candidates but by
recognized political parties or independent groups.

3\. The Secretary of the recognized political party or the independent group
is required to sign one nomination paper for an electoral district setting out
the names of the prescribed number of candidates for such district.

4\. At the election, parties and independent groups are represented by their
agents.

5\. Electors are required to vote for the party or the group of their choice.
They may also express their preference for any three candidates from the same
party or group.

6\. Votes polled by the party or the group would determine the number of
members such party or group will be entitled to return to Parliament from each
electoral district.

226

7\. There is no provision for by-elections ; and the composition of Parliament
is fixed for 6 years ; any vacancy is filled by declaring elected the
candidate from the same party or group whose name appears in the list on the
nomination paper and who has polled the next highest number of preferences. If
the list is exhausted, the party or the group nominates a member to fill the
vacancy.

On this basis Counsel submits that the party system is constitutionally
stronger here than in the United Kingdom ; that the provision for voter
preference for candidates does not affect the dominance of the party and no
provision has been enacted to dilute the obligation of M.P. s to the party.

In the teeth of Article 38 of the Constitution this Court cannot hold that a
Member of Parliament who belongs to the same political party as the President
who is also the Leader of that Party may not sign a notice of resolution for
the removal of such President ; and that the mere act of signing such notice
will make him liable to disciplinary action by the party. Nor have we been
called upon to consider such a question. In my understanding, the petitioners
have been expelled for signing the notice together with the opposition without
first raising the allegations within the party ; the ground of expulsion based
on their conduct in campaigning against the Executive Presidency is not
directed against the freedom of speech, the allegation being that they did so
without first raising it within the party ; in this connection Mr. Choksy very
properly conceded that had the petitioners been capriciously thwarted in
attempting to raise the issues within the party, they would be entitled to
agitate them in public. It follows that in such a situation the petitioners
would also be entitled to sign the resolution for the removal of the President
without further constraint. In the circumstances, there has been no violation
of Article 38.

There has been no violation of their freedom of speech as all that has been
questioned is the propriety of the manner of exercising such freedom ; as is
evident from the language used by them some of which is per se defamatory,
they have exceeded the bounds of such freedom. There is, therefore, no
violation of Article 14(1)(a). The freedom of conscience under Article 10 has
not been infringed because " freedom of conscience " therein connotes the
right of a person to entertain beliefs and doctrines concerning matters which

are regarded by him as being conducive to his spiritual well-being. See
Constitutional Law of India, Mahajan 6th Ed. 233 ; Rati Lal v. State of Bombay
(112). It does not connote the ordinary right which every individual has to
make decisions or to support a system of his choice according to his
conviction and judgment. This in fact appears to be the right which the
petitioners are asserting in their campaign against the Executive Presidential
System.

As regards the complaint that the expulsion violates Section 3 of the
Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act, Mr. de Silva contends that signing the
resolution is a " proceeding " in Parliament which is protected by Section 3.
He cited. Erskine May Parliamentary Practice p.87 where the author says that "
proceeding " is some formal action taken by the House which extends to the
whole process by which it reaches a decision. He proceeds to give
illustrations one of which is, giving notice of a motion. In the instant case,
what is in issue is not the giving of notice of a motion but the act of
signing it which takes place at a point of time anterior to its delivery to
the Speaker. As such no proceeding in Parliament has been impeached. Even if,
by a liberal construction, one were to construe it as a proceeding in
Parliament, the petitioners have not been expelled for signing the resolution
but for doing so without first raising the matter within the party. As such
there is no violation of rights relating to Parliamentary privilege.

The question, therefore, is one of party discipline the need for which is
supported by the authorities cited and by common sense. I agree with the
submission that under our law the Party is pre-eminent and carries the mandate
of the electors. Articles 4 (a) and 93 of the Constitution do not dilute the
dominance of the party. It is true that Article 4(a) refers to " elected
representatives of the People " but this is subject to Article 99 which
provides for proportional representation, which gives pre-eminence to the
party. It is only if the party polls enough votes that its candidates may
stand a chance of election.

The UNP Constitution imposes obligations on all members one of which is the
undertaking to accept the principles, policy and programme and code of conduct
of the party. The other important obligation is not to engage in political or
other activities likely to conflict with the said undertaking. There is a
further obligation not to bring

228

the party into disrepute. Then there are special obligations on M.P.s some of
which are -

1\. the duty to be bound by the directions of the Leader or the Deputy Leader
regarding matters in Parliament ;

2\. the duty to harmonize with the policy and code of conduct of the party ;

3\. the duty to vote in Parliament according to the Mandate of the
Parliamentary Party conveyed through the party whip.

I can see no illegality in these arrangements for group action. How can any
government or opposition function without disruption if the conduct of M.P.s
as a group cannot be regulated including in the matter of voting in the House
and each M.P. is free to do whatever he pleases? How can the party fulfil its
mandate given to it by the electors? Can an individual M.P. who has been
elected on the party vote and policy be heard to say " from today I am a free
man, the party and the group are secondary and are subordinate to me "? Can
Parliamentary business be transacted without the party having some assurance
as to how the M.P.s are going to vote? I see no evil in reasonable
restrictions on the conduct of M.P.s in Parliament based on group action or in
the obligation to harmonize with party policy or in the Whip system all of
which have the effect of ensuring the smooth functioning of Parliament itself
and peace, order and good government.

In this country the electors elect a government for six years after an
election which is often bitterly fought and in recent times in conditions of
turmoil and death. It is then the duty of both the opposition and the
government, owed to the people, to ensure as far as possible, stable
government. The Constitution has frozen party composition in the House for the
duration of Parliament and made provision for vacation of seats where a Member
of Parliament ceases by resignation, expulsion or otherwise to be a member of
the recognized political party or independent group on whose nomination paper
his name appeared at the time of his election to Parliament. It is not our
function to examine the wisdom of these provisions the object of which, I
believe, is to achieve stability of government. Group action, party discipline
and the Whip system are

229

complimentary. If we declare these arrangements to be invalid we would be
making the Constitution unworkable and as Sir John Donaldson MR observed in
Waltham Forest case (Supra) " We should......... be criticising the system
operating in Parliament itself."

This does not mean that a M.P. may never complain of interference with his
rights by unlawful action or direction. As a matter of principle occasion for
such complaint can arise ; but what those occasions are and how a M.P. may
assert his rights need not be gone into here because each case will depend on
its own facts and circumstances. The rights of a M.P. are not incompatible
with his obligations to the party the object of which is to ensure cohesion
and conjoint action ; in that sense he may be described as a cog in the party
machine ; but he is not a life-less cog liable to be subjected to unlawful or
capricious orders or directions without remedy.

Mr. de Silva strenuously contends that paragraph 5 of the Working Committee
resolution contains a distinct ground of expulsion based on the mere signing
of the resolution for the removal of the President. I cannot agree. That
paragraph should be read in the light of paragraphs 7 and 11. Paragraph 5
states that the signing of the resolution together with several members of the
opposition in Parliament is an act of betrayal of the parry membership and the
confidence placed by the people in the party and its leadership at successive
elections. Paragraph 6 relates to the vote of confidence in the President.
Paragraph 7 reads -

" And Whereas the aforesaid eight members have signed the said Notice of
Resolution without any prior intimation to the party or raising or discussing
the same within the Party Organizations or the Government Parliamentary
Group."

Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 relate to the campaign against the Executive
Presidential System. Paragraph 11 is as follows :

" And Whereas the aforesaid acts have all been done by the eight members
without first raising the said issues within the Party Organizations or the
Government Parliamentary Group as is required by the Party Constitution and
conventions "

230

It would be seen that paragraphs 5 and 7 are narrative of the facts and the
actual charge with reference to the resolution is contained in paragraph 11
which alone cites the provision which the petitioners have breached namely,
the Party Constitution and Conventions. I am, therefore, satisfied that the
ground of expulsion is the signing of the resolution without first raising it
within the Party Organizations or the Government Parliamentary Group. This is
put beyond doubt by the minutes of the Working Committee meeting R1 at which
the 2nd respondent stated that at no time had any of these members informed
the party that they intended moving through Parliament to remove the Leader of
Party from the Office of President. Nor had they made any charges against the
President.

For the above reasons, I hold that the grounds on which disciplinary action
has been taken against the petitioners are valid. The question whether their
expulsion is lawful and whether such punishment is justified in respect of all
of them will be considered later in this judgment.

**BREACH OF THE RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE**

I have now reached the most difficult question in these proceedings. Numerous
decisions and authorities have been cited none of which is exactly in point
because the combination of events with which we are here concerned is unique.
This is no ordinary expulsion of members of a voluntary association the like
of which is covered by precedent but an expulsion of the petitioners in the
context of a resolution for removing the President from his Office coupled
with a sustained public campaign by the petitioners against the Executive
Presidential System in the course of which they have attacked the President
and the Government. An attempt by the petitioners to obtain an injunction from
the District Court to restrain the UNP from taking disciplinary action failed
whereupon the party moved swiftly and expelled them.

In their petition they complain that they have been expelled without any
charges being served on them and without a hearing in breach of the party
guidelines for conducting disciplinary inquiries (P9) ; that the said
expulsion is vitiated by bias in that the President who is the accuser and
complainant presided over the deliberations of the Disciplinary Committee and
the Working Committee ; and that the

231

expulsion is mala fide in that (a) no disciplinary proceedings have been taken
against the other members of the party who signed the resolution and (b) it is
calculated to prevent them from taking judicial proceedings in the District
Court and Higher Courts for the vindication of their rights. During the
argument, Mr. H. L. de Silva, P.C. submitted that according to the proceedings
of the Working Committee (R1), the Disciplinary Committee which recommended
action against the petitioners subsequently participated in the deliberations
of the Working Committee which decided to expel the petitioners, which is
further evidence of bias ; and that the expulsion was a move by the supporters
of the President to scuttle the impeachment motion, which is further evidence
of mala fides.

In their objections the respondents have averred that the actions and conduct
of the petitioners were so manifestly and flagrantly in violation of party
discipline and policy and the Constitution of the Party as to justify
immediate expulsion. They further state that the guidelines P9 have been
issued for use by panels appointed by the Working Committee for the purpose of
conducting disciplinary inquiries where such inquiries become necessary and
for the general guidance of such panels conducting investigations into matters
of disputed facts arising upon complaints the truth of which has to verified.
The respondents deny the alleged violation of the rules of natural justice and
the allegation of mala fides.

Mr. de Silva cited many cases relating to social clubs, trade unions and
voluntary associations in which decisions for the expulsion of members have
been struck down for want of a fair hearing. He submitted that none of the
exceptions to the audi alteram partem rule would apply to the petitioners. The
rule that no man should be condemned without a fair hearing is too well
settled and requires no discussion. As such it will be unnecessary to discuss
the cases cited by learned Counsel. However, it would be relevant to quote a
passage from the judgment in John v. Rees (77) cited by Mr. de Silva. This was
a case in which a resolution of the Labour Party, inter alia, suspending the
activities of the Pembrokcshire Constituency Labour Party was challenged.
Megarry J. quoting from his own judgment in Fountaine v. Chesterton
(unreported) said (p. 1332) -

232

" 'The ideas of natural justice' said Iredell J. 'are regulated by no fixed
standard ; the ablest and the purest men have differed on the subject' ;
Calder v. Bull (113). In Ridge v. Baldwin (114) Lord Hodson referred to a
'certain vagueness' in the term but rejected the view that because the
requirements of natural justice depended upon the circumstances of the case,
this made natural justice so vague as to be inapplicable. He added : 'no one,
I think, disputes that three features of natural justice stand out - (1) the
right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal ; (2) the right to have notice of
charges of misconduct ; (3) the right to be heard in answer to those charges'.
I do not think I shall go far wrong if I regard ................ these three
features as constituting in all ordinary circumstances an irreduciable minimum
of the requirements of natural justice..........".

On the question whether a case is one in which the principles of natural
justice apply Megarry J. said in Gaiman v. National Association for Mental
Health (86). " It may be that there is no simple test, but that there is a
tendancy for the Court to apply the principles to all powers of decision
unless the circumstances suffice to exclude them."

**AUDI ALTERAM PARTEM**

Mr. Choksy submits the following propositions

1\. All the decisions cited by Mr. de Silva in which the Court has set aside
decisions for the failure to give a hearing are cases where there were
disputed questions of fact. In each such case the petitioner placed before
Court or indicated additional relevant facts which were not known to the
tribunal and, which he could have placed before the tribunal had he been given
a hearing.

2\. The right to a hearing is not an inveterate rule and depends on the facts
and circumstances of the case and the grounds on which disciplinary action has
been taken.

3\. If the matter which the petitioner says he could have placed before the
tribunal for consideration is a question of law or interpretation of statute
or a rule or contract, all such matters are questions which the Court must
decide. Therefore, the lack of hearing does not vitiate the decision because
the Court is in a position to decide it.

233

Mr. Choksy referred to the following cases in support of the proposition at
(1) above.

Innes Wylie (44)

Queen v. Saddler's Company ex p. Dinsdale (50) Fisher v. Keane (46)

Labouchere v. Earl of Wharancliffe (47) D'Arcy v. Adamson (52)

Graham v. Sinclair (53)

Lee v. Showmen's Guild (40)

Annamunthodo v. Oilfield Workers Trade Union (42)

Taylor v. National Union of Seamen (41)

I have examined these cases and the other cases cited by Mr. de Silva and find
that Mr. Choksy's proposition is justified. Counsel then proceeded to make
submissions which may be summarised thus -

(a) that a lack of hearing will not vitiate the expulsion because

(i) a hearing was a useless formality ;

(ii) the petitioner had no legitimate expectation of a hearing;

(iii) the Working Committee was under a duty to act speedily in the interest
of the party and was not fettered by natural justice in taking disciplinary
action against the petitioners.

(b) , that in any event the issues involved being questions of law resting on
admitted facts, the Supreme Court will decide those issues in the exercise of
its jurisdiction under the proviso to Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution.
This would adequately compensate for the lack of a hearing by the Working
Committee.

Before I consider the above submissions, it would be appropriate to consider
the nature and scope of our jurisdiction under the proviso to Article 99 (13)
(a) and the nature of the right invoked by the petitioners. In terms of
Article 99 (13) (a) a Member of Parliament does not vacate his seat until
after the expiry of one month from

234

the date of his ceasing to be a member of the political party to which he
belongs, by reason of his expulsion from the party. In this context, I think,
the word 'ceasing' connotes de facto and not de jure cessation of the
membership of his parry. He, therefore, continues to retain his status as M.P.
on behalf of his parry for the prescribed period notwithstanding the
expulsion. If he fails to apply to this Court within one month from the
expulsion, he vacates his seat. If he applies and the Court determines the
expulsion to be invalid the seat does not become vacant in which event he
would continue to hold office without a break either in his status as a M.P.
or as a member of his party. If, however, the Court determines the expulsion
to be valid, then, the seat becomes vacant but from the date of the
determination, and not earlier.

The right of a M.P. to relief under Article 99 (13) (a). is a legal right and
forms part of his constitutional rights as a M.P.. If his complaint is that he
has been expelled from the membership of his party in breach of the rules of
natural justice, he will ordinarily be entitled to relief ; and this Court may
not determine such expulsion to be valid unless there are overwhelming reasons
warranting such decision. Such decision would be competent only in the most
exceptional circumstances permitted by law and in furtherence of the public
good the need for which should be beyond doubt. As Megarry J. said in
Fountaine v. Chesterton (Supra) "......... if there is any doubt, the
applicability of the principles of natural justice will be given the benefit
of that doubt " (cited by Megarry J. in John v. Rees and the expulsion will be
struck down.

Rule 8(3) of the UNP Constitution inter alia confers on the NEC the power to
take disciplinary action against any member " in a manner suitable in the
circumstances of each case " and to impose appropriate punishment. In terms of
the delegation R2, the power is exercised by the Working Committee. The rule
permits the tribunal to adopt the procedure which is appropriate to each case
; but natural justice cannot be excluded in determining such procedure. It is
evident from the party guidelines for the conduct of disciplinary inquiries
(P9) that the UNP itself had understood the need to conform to the rules of
natural justice. The parry cannot, even if it wished to, stipulate for a power
to condemn a man unheard Lee v. Showmen's Guild (40).

235

It is common ground that the petitioners have been expelled without informing
them of the charge or giving them an opportunity of being heard. The question
then is, can such a procedure be justified? Mr. Choksy addressed us at length
on this question. He relied on certain grounds of justification based on the
subject matter of the proceedings. He also submitted that in the circumstances
of this case 'the hearing by this Court is in substance the right to
antecedent hearing and hence the petitioners cannot seek relief on the ground
that the Working Committee had not given them a hearing.

In R. v. Secretary of State for Environment ex p. Brent London Borough Council
(79) Ackner LJ said -

" It is not possible to lay down rigid rules as to when principles of natural
justice are to apply, nor as to their scope and extent. Everything depends on
the subject matter."

The Court held that the Minister had acted wrongly in reducing Brent's
entitlement to a grant without giving them a hearing. The Court declined to
hold that had a hearing been given the same decision would have been
inevitable. In any event the Court was not prepared in the particular
circumstances of the case to say that a hearing would have been a useless
formality. The test to be applied in such cases " is not whether there has
been a breach of the rules of natural justice but whether the procedure
followed was unfair to the applicant. If it was unfair, then it cannot be
argued that the decision should not be struck down on the ground that it must
have been the same ". 'Administrative Law' David Foulkes 7th Ed. 302.

Glynn v. Keele University (65) illustrates how the Court's approach is
affected by the subject matter. The Vice Chancellor found an undergraduate
guilty of being seen naked in the campus with other students and fined him
510/- and excluded him from residence on the campus for the remaining part of
the academic year. No hearing was given. The Court held that he had been
denied natural justice but refused relief exercising its discretion against
the grant of an injunction. The student did not deny his involvement in the
incident. The Court observed that no question of fact was involved, that the
punishment on him was a proper one and he had suffered no injustice despite
the loss of an opportunity to mitigate the offence.

236

In the instant case, if we hold that natural justice has been denied, we have
no discretion to deny relief, unless we can do so on the analogy of the Common
Law principle applicable to actions that the Court does not act in vain
(Malloch v. Aberdeen Corporation (84) . The remedy here being a constitutional
right, I doubt whether this Court can exercise a discretion in granting relief
and hence prefer to decide this case on the assumption that there is no such
discretion.

Malloch's case (Supra) concerned a teacher who was dismissed without a
hearing. The House of Lords held. that even though his claims were those of
strict legal entitlement relating to the validity or the interpretation of the
regulations in terms of which he was dismissed, he had an arguable case and
hence the requirement of a hearing was not a useless formality. Prof. Wade
(Administrative Law 6th Ed. p. 535) puts it thus -

" ............. in the case of a discretionary administrative decision, such
as the dismissal of a teacher or the expulsion of a student, hearing his case
will often soften the heart of the authority and alter their decision, even
though it is clear from the outset that punitive action would be justified ".

Referring to this approach Lord Denning (Cinnamond v. British Airports
Authority (83) said -

" But it only applies when there is a legitimate expectation of being heard.
In cases where there is no legitimate expectation there is no call for a
hearing ".

Cinnamond's case relates to six mini-cab drivers. They had been prosecuted on
numerous occasions for loitering at the Airport and touting for passengers.
They persistently refused to pay fines and continued to loiter and tout for
fares. The Airport Authority acting in the exercise of statutory power
prohibited them access to the Airport until further notice. It was held that
there was no breach of the rules of natural justice because they had no
legitimate expectation of a hearing. Lord Denning observed that if they were
ready to comply with the rules they could have made representations
immediately on receiving the prohibition ; but they did not do so and
concluded thus:

**237**

" The simple duty of the Airport Authority was to act fairly and reasonably.
It seems to me that it has acted fairly and reasonably ".

Shaw L J observed that in view of the long history of contraventions at the
Airport the only way of dealing with the situation was by excluding them
altogether.

I shall now consider a case involving the expulsion of members of an
association where the Court found that the body exercising that power was
under a duty to act with great speed and was not fettered by the rules of
natural justice. Gaiman v. National Association for Mental Health (86). The
association was a company limited by guarantee. Some of its members were also
members of the church of Scientology who did not believe in psychiatry for
curing mental patients. For several years, there was a state of hostility
between the Scientologists and the Association. In their campaign the
Scientologists published articles and held demonstrations. They described the
psyshiatrists as brutal, a terror, involved in personal gain, intolerant and
fascist ; one of them was described as the new Hitler in England psychiatrist
clinics were described as " Death Camps." The Scientologists then made a bid
for power in the Association, to make their voice heard within the Association
and to " make a splash." On 7th November they submitted nomination papers for
election to office at an Annual General Meeting scheduled for the 12th of that
month. On the 10th the Council decided to terminate the membership of 302
members " known or reasonably suspected of being Scientologists " by
requesting them to resign under Article 7(B) whereupon subject to a right of
appeal they ceased to 4e members of the Association. They sought declarations
and injunctions against the expulsion.

Megarry J. said that he was not concerned with the merits of the views held by
psychiatrists or scientologists and added -

" I am concerned with an entirely different and much narrower question,
namely, the right of the Council of the Association to use Article 7(B) to
exclude from the Association those who are known or reasonably suspected of
being Scientologists. It is beyond question that Scientologists have for long
been attacking the Association in a variety of ways. The attacks have been

238

 virulent, and like the sentiments, the language, I think, speaks for itself.
I need say no more about it than that much of it cannot be described as
moderate and reasoned argument designed to convert those who hold what are
conceived to be erroneous views " (p. 374).

He held that, in the circumstances, Article 7 (B) excludes natural justice ;
the Council was under a duty to exercise their powers in what they bona fide
believe to be in the interest of the Corporation ; this includes a duty to act
with great speed unfettered by natural justice. He observed that a member had
no absolute right of membership but that it was subject to bona fide
termination. If he were wrong, in that view he thought that the injunctions
should be refused as a matter of discretion.

Mr. Choksy's final submission on this part of the case relates to the
possibility of excluding the need for a hearing, in limited cases, where there
is statutory provision for subsequent review. The proposition is that a
statutory right for an administrative appeal or even full judicial review on
the merits is sufficient to negative the implied duty to hear before the
original decision is made, provided that there is no serious detriment to the
person affected or there is also a paramount need for prompt action ; this is
not meant to be adopted as a general rule ; but if in particular the initial
decision is provisional in the sense that it does not take effect until the
expiry of a prescribed period for objections, the opportunity thus afforded to
an aggrived person is in substance a right to an antecedent hearing. De
Smith's Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th Ed. 193-194.

Mr. de Silva contends that this Court should not lightly assume that hearing
was a useless formality or speculate on how the Working Committee might have
acted if they heard the petitioners ; and that if the respondents acted fairly
they would not have resorted to summary expulsion of the petitioners. He urged
us to bear in mind that by reason of the procedure adopted, the petitioners
have been deprived of an irreplaceable right. He cited the following passage
from John v. Rees (77) (1969) 2 WLR 1294, 1335 Megarry J. said

"............ the path of the law is strewn with examples of open and shut
cases which, somehow, were riot; of answerable charges which, in any event,
were completely answered ; of inexplicable

239

conduct which was fully explained ; of fixed and unalterable determinations
that, by discussions, suffered a change."

I appreciate that it is not possible to come to a finding on the contentions
advanced before us on a piece-meal approach with reference to this authority
or the other. In my view our decision rests on an application of more then one
principle, cumulatively, to the facts and circumstances of this case bearing
also in mind the legal safeguards to which the petitioners are entitled. In
this respect, Mr. Choksy drew our attention to the averments contained in the
petition and contended that all the grounds of challenge to the expulsion are
legal grounds based on the provisions of the Constitution or statute law and
the interpretation of the UNP Constitution and the determination of the
contractual obligations of the petitioners to the party ; that the basic facts
of signing the resolution and conducting a campaign against the Executive
Presidential System are admitted ; that their expulsion has not taken effect
and its validity is yet to be decided by this Court ; and that the conduct of
the petitioners established by the evidence including the documentary evidence
before this Court completely justifies the decision to expel them from the
party without a hearing. This brings me to an examination of the evidence
relating to the conduct of the petitioners.

The Speaker's communication of the notice of the resolution to the President
on 28.08.91 was the beginning of a serious crisis in the government. In R6,
the Leader of the Opposition is reported to have told the press that she had
secret talks with UNP M.P.s over a period of time about the resolution ;
petitioners deny this and hence R6 cannot be held against them even if they
had failed to publish a contradiction thereof in the press. However, the
resolution itself could not have come about suddenly without some secret
planning by the petitioners while they remained as fully committed members of
the party. Even after the resolution had been delivered to the Speaker, the
petitioners Nos. 5 and 8 were secretive and pretended to join the other
members of the Cabinet in passing a vote of confidence in the President. No
explanation acceptable to this Court has been adduced justifying such conduct
and I agree with Mr. Choksy that these two petitioners are thereby guilty of
gross misconduct. The two Ministers then resigned from the Cabinet. The
petitioners Nos. 6 and 7 followed suit having resigned from the posts of State
Minister

240

and Project Minister respectively. Thereafter all the petitioners launched a
joint public campaign.

R3A to R3G and R4A to R4L clearly show the campaign carried on between
28.08.91 and 06.09.91, prior to the impugned expulsion. As stated earlier in
this judgment, during this period the petitioners not only campaigned against
the Executive Presidential System but also discussed in public the various
allegations contained in the resolution against the President. There is no
constitutional provision which permits such a procedure. In America, The House
Judiciary Committee recommends impeachment by the House and trial by the
Senate on charges supported by " clear and convincing " evidence. 'American
Constitutional Law' 2nd Ed. Laurence H. Tribe p. 292\. Under our law the
proper procedure is for Parliament to first pass the resolution by a two third
majority after which the Speaker refers it to this Court for inquiry and
report. In the circumstances, the conduct of the petitioners including senior
Parliamentarians in disclosing in public the serious allegations contained in
the resolution cannot be construed as being bona fide, and gives credence to
the allegation that they used the resolution as a cover to cause insult and
injury to the character, integrity and ability of the Leader of the Party in
his capacity as President of the country. Such contumacious conduct
constitutes indiscipline in the party unrelated to the exercise of
constitutional rights. One does not look into the Party Constitution to see
whether it is covered by express provision.

There were daily Press Conferences conducted by the petitioners led by
petitioners Nos. 4, 5 and 8. Some of them have been attended by all the
petitioners. There was also regular statements issued to the media. Almost
daily they assured the public that they had 47 UNP M.P.s with them. On
31.08.91 at a news conference attended by all the petitioners, petitioner No.
4 spoke of the " degeneration of the UNP and democracy " while the petitioner
No. 8 charged that the telephones of Ministers were being unlawfully tapped by
the government (R3F) ; on the same day the petitioner No. 8 alleged that the
President was suffering from " dictatorship mania " and exhorted the people to
save democracy (R4B) ; on 01.09.91 the petitioner No. 4 in a media statement
said that the President was running a " one man show " (an allegation which
has been repeated regularly) and at a news conference the petitioners Nos. 5
and 8

241

compared the President to the Emperor without cloths who wished every-body
else to say that he was in fine garments, meaning that the President lived on
flattery ; the petitioner No. 4 referred to the " autocratic dictatorial "
rule under Premadasa (R3A, R3B) ; on 02.09.91 when the petitioner No.8 visited
the Education Ministry after resignation, he told the officials that the
President was undermining the Ministers using Secretaries as spies (R4E) ; on
03.09.91 there was a news conference at which the petitioner No. 4 alleged
that the IPKF had been sent back to placate the LTTE after giving arms and
money to the LTTE to attack the IPKF ; also that when there is a war there is
a grand Gam Udawa Celebration ; the petitioner No. 5 suggested that the
government encouraged gambling and that Cabinet Ministers had been close
associates of Jo Sim and displayed photographs said to be of some Cabinet
Ministers posing with Jo Sim (R3C and R4G) ; on 05.09.91 the petitioner No. 4
made a speech at a temple religious ceremony and said that the President
pretended to govern justly (R4L).

As Megarry J. observed in Gaiman's case (Supra) I am myself not concerned with
" the merits of the views " held by the UNP and the petitioners, (described in
the Press as "rebels"). I am concerned with the right of the Working Committee
to have proceeded against the petitioners without a hearing. As in Gaiman's
case here too the attacks have been " virulent " and " much of it cannot be
described as being moderate and reasoned argument designed to convert those
who hold what are conceived to be erroneous views." Mr. Choksy submitted that
in Gaiman's case the Scientologists had been making representations for
several years ; here they launched a campaign without any prior discussion
within the party. I would add that in Gaiman's case there was no threat to
stable government in the country; nor was there any campaign which was likely
to confuse or inflame the public mind against the Head of a State, the
government and the party in power. The interests involved in that case were
those of the Mental Health Association whereas this case involves the
interests of a party which has been voted into power by the electors and above
all the interests of the public who are often the victims of such
indisciplined controversy.

Well before the impugned expulsion, 116 UNP M.P.s had informed the speaker
.that they would not support the resolution (R15) and expressed confidence in
the President (R16). Some of them

242

complained that their signatures had been obtained on the notice of resolution
by deceipt and misrepresentation. The petitioners allege that undue influence
had been brought to bear on M.P.s to prevent them from voting for the
resolution. I am not concerned with the merits of these allegations. What is
relevant is that by 03.09.91 it was known that the division in the party was 8
against 116. Undaunted by it, the petitioners had informed the media that they
would hold public meetings throughout the country commencing on 05.09.91
(R3C-R3F).

On 05.09.91 the petitioners filed actions in the District Court praying, inter
alia, for an injunction to restrain the Working Committee and/or the NEC from
taking disciplinary action against them as members of the party (P4). Mr.
Choksy submits that thereby they hoped to tie the hands of the party and be
free to continue with their campaign unfettered by disciplinary action. The
District Court declined relief whereupon the Working Committee expelled them.
I am satisfied that the Working Committee, acting in the interests of the
party, had no choice but to act with speed and take disciplinary action
against the petitioners without giving them a hearing. From all the
circumstances, it does not appear that the petitioners had any serious
intention of appearing before the Working Committee or the NEC for the purpose
of explaining their conduct. On the other hand their object was to legally
restrain those bodies pending a judicial determination of the dispute. I do
not mean to blame them for seeking such relief. The point I make is that if
the petitioners themselves were not prepared to submit to the party councils,
then, there is no force in their complaint that the Working-Committee had
failed to give them a hearing. I hold that the Working Committee acted fairly
and reasonably in taking disciplinary proceedings against the petitioners in
the way it did.

I am also of the view that the petitioners' rights were not materially
affected by the order of expulsion. I have earlier explained the state of
their rights pending the determination of this Court. All the issues here
relate to legal matters arising upon admitted facts. In the circumstances, the
subsequent hearing by this Court is in substance the right to an antecedent
hearing. Mr. de Silva submitted that had a hearing been given, the petitioners
could have explained to the Working Committee why they failed to first raise
the issues before the Party Organizations ; their explanation to this Court is
that

243

they were not free to discuss matters within the party ; but this is bald
statement and I see no injustice caused to the petitioners in being deprived
of an opportunity to give an explanation before the working Committee, in the
particular circumstances of this case. I hold that there has been no violation
of the rules of natural justice.

**BIAS AND MALA FIDES**

There is a wealth of authority on the traditional concept of 'bias'; as such
it is unnecessary to discuss the many decisions cited by Counsel. Suffice it
to observe that these decisions relate to Courts and other tribunals
exercising judicial or quasi judicial power examples of the latter being
licensing justices in local bodies and authorities in public institutions or
trade unions vested with quasi judicial power. The situations in which 'bias'
arises may be summed up as follows:

(a) Licensing justices : bias results where particular justices having
functioned as a Committee thereafter display an obvious interest in the making
of the final decision e.g. by retaining Counsel to oppose the application on
their behalf. They also either sit as Judges or are present with the Judges at
the final hearing.

(b) The presence of an interested person with the tribunal e.g. accuser, the
person who made the original decision coming up for consideration by the
tribunal or the Solicitor who conducted the case. Such situations may' arise
in connection with a dismissal, suspension of office or other punishment of a
statutory employee or the removal of the authority to engage in a trade e.g.
supplying milk to a statutory board.

(c) The Judge having some interest or connection with a party or the subject
matter which affects his impartiality or detachment. Examples of orders
vitiated by such bias are a conviction of an accused by a Court or a fair rent
order in respect of a house made by the Rent Assessment Committee.

The two broad tests of 'bias' are (a) the real likelihood of bias (often
arising by a breach of the rule 'nemo judex in causa sua' and (b) reasonable
suspicion of bias (arising by a breach of the principle 'Justice should
manifestly be seen to be done'). Lord Widgery CJ said-

244

" Those two tests are often overlapping, and it may be that one is appropriate
to one situation and another is appropriate to another situation."

R. v. Altrincham Justices ex p Pennington (106).

Mr. de Silva sees no room for relaxing the above rules in their application to
the case before us and submits that the decision of the Working Committee is
vitiated by reason of the presence of the President who is the accuser and the
participation of the Disciplinary Committee in the final decision. Mr. Choksy
submits that these rules cannot be generally applied to all quasi judicial
bodies with the same rigour and that a distinction should be made between
professional disciplinary tribunals which bear a closer resemblance to Courts
and other bodies. In R. v. Leicestershire Fire Authority ex p Thompson (100)
Griffiths J. said -

" Clearly, when one is dealing with a quasi judicial body, there has to be
some degree of flexibility and there may be exceptional circumstances in which
it will not be right to apply the rule in its full rigour."

There are certain forms of conduct which do not necessarily constitute bias.
Examples are (a) mere general interest in the object to be pursued by a
tribunal e.g. in the case of a business association. (b) the interest which a
tribunal may have in the discharge of its functions having regard to the
object or purpose of the body e.g. the interest of the Medical Council in
dealing with improper conduct in the profession. Judicial Review of
Administrative Tribunals in South Africa L.A. Rose Innes 176, 177. S. A. de
Smith (Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th Ed.) refers to the element
of personal hostility or friction which may form the history of the expulsion
of a member of a voluntary association and states -

" The ground of expulsion may be opposition to the declared policies of the
association. The rules of the association permit the committee to act, in a
sense, as Judges in their own cause. The expelled member will not, therefore,
succeed in having the decision set aside by the Courts merely by demonstrating
that the committee were not, or were not likely to be, impartial towards him "
(p. 264).

245

Dealing with special problems in the administration of internal discipline in
certain bodies and associations de Smith observes that the decision makers can
hardly insulate themselves from the general ethos of their organization ; they
are likely to have firm views about their affairs and will often be familiar
with the issues before they enter upon adjudication. He therefore suggests
that the rule as to bias must be tempered with realism for instance by
requiring evidence of actual bias rather than mere likelihood of bias before a
decision is set aside by a Court (p. 256).

Mr. Choksy submits that one of the objects of the UNP under Rule 4(a) of its
Constitution is to gain power at elections ; that this includes remaining in
power for carrying out its programme of work ; and that the interest for
maintaining cohesion in the party and the interest in party policy including
the continuance of the Executive Presidential System is not bias ; the members
of the Party Councils including the 2nd respondent are entitled to such
interests ; that there was nothing wrong in the members of the Disciplinary
Committee in participating in the deliberations of the Working Committee ;
that at the meetings they did not go into the merits of the resolution but
expelled the petitioners on account their actions without first raising the
issues within the party ; and that the presence of the President without
participation does not violate the decision of the Working Committee.

On the alleged mala fides, Mr. Choksy submits that there was nothing wrong in
taking proceedings against the petitioners soon after the order of the
District Judge as it was necessary to act urgently in the interest of the
party and to prevent confusion which the petitioners sought to create in the
country in breach of their party obligations. Replying to the complaint that
disciplinary action has been taken only against the petitioners, the
respondents state that no action was necessary after joint action was taken by
116 M.P.s in R15 and R16. However, the allegations against three of them have
been referred to the Disciplinary Committee for consideration and
recommendation to the Working Committee.

Having considered the submissions of Counsel for the parties in the light of
authorities and the evidence, I hold that the decision of the Working
Committee (P1A) is not vitiated by bias or mala fides.

246

**EXPULSION; IS IT WARRANTED?**

Mr. Choksy submits that the conduct of the petitioners subsequent to their
expulsion confirms the view that their conduct prior to that constitutes gross
misconduct. In the statement of facts, I have referred to the fact that as
from 10.09.91 they proceeded to hold public meetings in the major towns in the
country. I shall refer to some of these meetings for another purpose. On the
question of the appropriateness of the expulsion, I am of the view that it is
justified solely on the ground of their conduct prior to the expulsion.

I have indicated earlier that the duty of the party should be construed not in
the narrow sense of its political interests but in the context of its larger
duty to the people as their repository of their mandate to ensure stable
government in the country irrespective of any differences of opinion which may
exist in a democratic set up. It is the people who have to bear brunt of all
upheavals, economic, social and political. Left to themselves they are perhaps
content to await the next election to resolve issues such as the Executive
Presidential System. Even if members of the party wish to raise such issues
prematurely they should do so peacefully as has been in fact done when the Sri
Lanka Freedom Party met the President in 1989 (P16) and subsequently in the
deliberations of the All Party Conference. These petitioners have engaged the
public on the issues in breach of party obligations and in a manner likely to
disrupt normalcy in the country. There is nothing to mitigate their conduct
and the order of expulsion is logical and justified. It seems to me that the
petitioners are attempting .to do the impossible i.e. to revolt against the
party and the government as non members may do and yet to retain their seats
as M.P. s under the party label. That was possible prior to 1978 when members
were free to cross the floor but not under the present Constitution. On the
facts of this case, I am of the view that the remedy of expulsion befits the
mischief unleashed by the petitioners.

The evidence shows that all the petitioners have acted conjointly each of them
playing a vital role, whatever be its magnitude. All of them have attended
joint press conferences and provided moral support to their leadership. None
of them has urged any reason for treating him more leniently and I see none ;
I hold that the expulsion of each petitioner is justified.

247

The subsequent conduct of the petitioners not only affirms their guilt but
also establishes mala fides on their part. They have a constitutional remedy
against their expulsion. Whilst availing of that remedy they went round the
country. During their campaign they were generally not adducing facts or
arguments but hurling accusations or insults.

As a meeting on 10.09.91 the petitioner No. 5 said that they had brought down
the President from his throne to the steps of the old Parliament (R10C). On
22.09.91 the petitioner No. 4 alleged that the LTTE had been given anti
aircraft guns without Cabinet sanction (R10G). On 29.09.91 the same
petitioners compared the President to 'Bokassa' said to be a dictator in
Central Africa (13101). On 27.10.91 he said that the UNP is shattered and the
country is facing a terror worse than the JVP (1320). At a meeting on 29.10.91
the petitioner No. 5 announced the formation of a new party (R20A).

In their petition, the petitioners made serious allegations of a personal
nature against the District Judge of Colombo arising from the judicial order
(P6) whereby the petitioners' applications for injunctive relief were refused.
At the hearing, this Court pointed out to the fact that these are not
allegations within our purview ; also that the District Judge is not a party
to these proceedings and hence not in a position to defend himself. Having
consulted the petitioner, Mr. de Silva very properly agreed to withdraw these
allegations but without prejudice to the position taken by the petitioners. I
agree with the order proposed by my brother Fernando J. for expunging the
offending passages in the averments from these proceedings.

**CONCLUSION**

For the foregoing reasons, I determine that the expulsion of each of the eight
petitioners in these applications (Special) Nos. 4-11/91 was valid. In the
result I dismiss their applications. These proceedings have raised
constitutional questions of public or general importance for the resolution of
which the parties have contributed. In the circumstances, I make no order as
to costs ; each party will bear his costs.

248

**WADUGODAPITIYA J.**

I have had the benefit of reading the judgments of my brothers Mark Fernando
J. and Kulatunga J. They have narrated in quite some detail, the facts
pertaining to these eight applications and the events that led up to the
filing of these applications. In both judgments the narration is comprehensive
and accurate, and I must say that I have nothing to add.

I have also considered very carefully, the reasoning and the conclusions in
both judgments and would agree with those of my brother Kulatunga J. In the
result, I would determine that, upon a consideration of all the material
presented before us, the expulsion of the petitioners S.C. (Special) Nos :
4/91, 5/91, 6/91, 7/91, 8/91, 9/91, 10/91 and 11/91 was valid. I accordingly
dismiss all eight applications.

There is no other matter that needs to be mentioned. That is the fact that all
eight petitioners referred to above made very serious allegations in their
petitions against the District Judge of Colombo in connection with the
unsuccessful actions filed in the District Court of Colombo on 5.9.91. At the
hearing, Learned President's Counsel appearing for the petitioners was
informed by Court that the allegations of partiality made by the petitioners
against the District Judge of Colombo were obviously irrelevant to these
proceedings ; that this Court is not called upon to make a determination in
that respect, and that, in any event, the District Judge of Colombo has not
been made a party to these proceedings. After consulting the petitioners
Learned President's Counsel agreed to withdraw the offending passages in the
pleadings without prejudice to the rights of the petitioners to persue the
matter elsewhere. I am in entire agreement with what has been stated on this
matter by my brothers Mark Fernando J. and Kulatunga J. and would myself
direct the Registrar to expunge the offending passages from the record.

I make no order as to costs. Each party will bear his own costs.

_Expulsion of all eight petitioners upheld._
