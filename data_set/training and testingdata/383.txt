SUPREME COURT

DHEERARATNE, J. AND  
PERERA, J.  
SC APPEAL NO. 81/94  
CA NO. HC MCA 302/94  
MC MT. LAVINIA NO. 79393  
OCTOBER 06, 1994  
  
_Contempt of Court - Summary punishment - Code of Criminal Procedure Act,
section 449 (1) - Breach of natural justice - Validity of the conviction.  
_  
Immediately after the appellant had given evidence in a criminal case the
Magistrate held that the appellant had given false evidence and proceeded to
convict and sentence him forthwith acting under the Judicature Act. The High
Court attributed the conviction to section 449 (i) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure Act and upheld the order.  
  
**Held :  
**  
(1)  Whichever provision was applicable it is settled law that the gist of the
accusation should have been made clear to the appellant and he should have
been given an opportunity to furnish an explanation.  
  
(2) The summary conviction and sentence of the appellant were a clear breach
of the principles of natural justice.  
  
**Case referred to :  
**  
_Daniel Appuhamy v. The Queen -_ (1962) 64 NLR 481.  
  
**APPEAL** from the judgment of the High Court.

LR 07 on the same view.

**FERNANDO, J.  
**  
The appellant was a witness at a criminal trial. Immediately after he  gave
evidence, the learned Magistrate made an order in which he held that the
appellant had given false evidence; stated his reasons for that conclusion;
and dealt with the appellant for contempt of court under the provisions of the
Judicature Act. He then sentenced the appellant to 3 months' rigorous
imprisonment. He then acquitted the accused.  
  
On appeal, the learned High Court Judge considered the Magistrate as having
acted under section 449 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and upheld
his order, but reduced the sentence.  
  
Whichever provision was applicable, it is settled law that the gist of the
accusation against him should have been made clear to the appellant (even
though not with the same particularity required in an indictment) and he
should have been given an opportunity to furnish an explanation : See Daniel
Appuhamy v. The Queen.(1)

**313**

In this case it is common ground that the learned Magistrate neither
communicated the essence of the accusation to the appellant nor gave him an
opportunity to furnish an explanation; instead, he proceeded to convict and
sentence him forthwith. This is a clear breach of the principles of natural
justice.  
  
State Counsel concedes that the order cannot stand. We allow the appeal and
set aside the orders of the High Court and the Magistrate's Court.  
  
**DHEERARATNE, J**. - I agree.  
  
**PERERA, J.   \- **I agree.  
  
_**Appeal allowed.**_
