PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

PETITION NO. 1 OF 1989  
19 JUNE 1989 TO 30 JUNE 1992

_     Presidential Election Petition - General intimidation - Non-compliance
with provisions of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 - Failure to
conduct a free and fair election in accordance with the provisions of the
Presidential Elections Act - Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 as. 91
(a), 91 (b) - interpretation of s. 91 (a) - Burden of proof - ss. 101, 102
Evidence Ordinance._

The election to the office of President of Sri Lanka was held on 19 December
1988. There were three candidates namely Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike
(Petitioner) of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Ranasinghe Premadasa (1st
respondent) of the United National Party (UNP) and Oswin Abeygunasekera of the
Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP). The petitioner received 2289860 or 44.95% of
the votes, the 1st respondent 2569199 or 50.43% of the votes and
Abeygunasekera 235719 or 4.63% of the votes. The first respondent won by a
Majority of 279339 votes. Of the eligible voters 55.32% voted. The 2nd
respondent as Commissioner of Elections declared the 1st respondent elected to
the office of President of Sri Lanka.

The petitioner by petition filed on 09 January 1989 challenged the election of
the 1st respondent on the following grounds.

1\. By reason of general intimidation the majority of electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred under
section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 (hereinafter
referred to as the Act).

2

2\. By reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act relating to
elections, the election was not conducted in accordance with the principles
laid down in such provisions and such non-compliance affected the result of
the election under s. 91 (b) of the Act.

3\. By reason of "other circumstances" to wit, the failure of the Commissioner
of Elections (2nd respondent) and/or certain members of his staff to conduct a
free and fair election, in accordance with the provisions of the Act as set
out more particularly in paragraph 9 read with paragraph 8 of the petition,
the majority of the electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred under section 91 (a) of the Act.

The petitioner called 546 witnesses, the 1st respondent 399 witnesses and the
2nd respondent 32 witnesses.

The pivotal question in this case turns on the correct interpretation of
section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act which reads as follows:

"The election of a candidate to the office of President shall be declared to
be void on an election petition on any of the following grounds which may be
proved to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court namely:

(a) that by reason of general bribery, general treating, or general
intimidation, or other misconduct, or other circumstances, whether similar to
those before enumerated or not, the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred".

This Court in its preliminary order (reported at (1989) 1 Sri LR 420, 261,
270) held that mere proof of the several instances or acts of general
intimidation would not suffice to avoid an election. In addition, the
petitioner has to prove that these several acts or instances had the result or
consequence that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. On the basis of instances or acts
of general intimidation established by evidence, the Court may draw a
reasonable inference therefrom that the majority of electors may have been
prevented from electing the candidate of their choice. In a case of general
intimidation, the question that arises is - from the proved acts of
intimidation of electors is it reasonable to suppose that the result of the
election may have been affected? This is the true meaning of the words `the
majority of the electors may have been prevented from electing the

3

candidate they preferred. But it will be open to the returned candidate to
show that the gross intimidation could not possibly have affected the result
of the election. Proof of widespread violence directed towards preventing
electors from voting was not enough. There was the requirement of proof of an
additional and distinct ingredient of the charge that the majority of the
electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred.

The petitioner's case was one of preventive intimidation and not coercive
intimidation.

In the expression "were or may have been prevented" there is a significant
difference between the words "were" and " may have been". The term may was
designedly used because mathematical proof that the majority of electors were
in fact prevented, in many a case is impossible of attainment. The burden to
prove that the majority of electors were in fact prevented is difficult and it
is almost impossible to produce the requisite proof.

**Held**

(1) (a) The preliminary order made by the Court is binding on the Court. No
gloss or deviation from the order is permissible. Further trial proceeded on
the basis of the interpretation placed by Court on s. 91 (a) in the
preliminary order.

(b) Proof of widespread violence directed towards preventing electors from
voting is not enough. Proof is necessary also of the additional ingredient
that the general intimidation had the effect that the majority of voters were
or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred.

(2) In so far as a charge under s. 91 (b) is concerned a Court must reach a
finding as to whether the non-compliance affected the result of the election.
The Court then must consider the question whether the petitioner would have
succeeded but for the non-compliance.

Per G. P S. de Silva, C.J. "for that purpose evidence of party affiliations
would be relevant and admissible, notwithstanding the secrecy provisions would
it then be reasonable to say that the secrecy provisions do not apply to sec.
91 (b) and they apply to sec. 91 (a). We think not."

(3) The evidence of group leaders regarding party affiliations is permissible
as a mode of proof that the voters were prevented from electing the candidate
of

4

their choice and will not offend the secrecy provisions. The Court may address
its mind to the pattern of voter behaviour.

(4) On a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence relating to the
charge of general intimidation, it appears that the thrust of the J.V.P.
violence was directed against the U.N.P. Between the period 17.09.88 and
19.12.88 (16.09.88 being the date on which the Working Committee of the U.N.P.
chose the 1st respondent as the candidate) as many as 413 organisers, office-
bearers and supporters of the U.N.P. were killed, and 237 were attacked. The
acts of violence against the U.N.P. were spread throughout 80 polling
divisions in 15 electorate districts, whereas the anti-S.L.F.P. incidents
occurred in 23 polling divisions in 13 electoral districts. Further the
incidents against the U.N.P. were spread over a longer period of time.
Numerous threats, killings and attacks on local party organisers and office-
bearers of the U.N.P. branches at the village level resulted in a serious and
irreparable setback to the organization and the campaign of the 1st
respondent. In addition there were resignations from U.N.P. branches by
office-bearers and even ordinary members consequent upon threats conveyed by
letters. Besides, there were threats directed at office-bearers and members of
the J.S.S. and large numbers were compelled to resign. The J.S.S. actively
supported the U.N.P. at previous electrons. It is natural that all this would
have had a strong adverse effect on supporters of the 1st respondent at the
Presidential election. The oral and documentary evidence establishes that the
weight of the J.V.P. intimidation and violence was directed at the U.N.P. and
its supporters and this has contributed in no small measure to the low voter
turn-out on 19.12.88 (election day.)

(5) The burden of proof however slight it may be is on the petitioner that the
acts or instances of intimidation had the requisite effect, namely, that the
majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred. The petitioner has not succeeded in
establishing that the result of the election may have been affected.

Accordingly the charge of "General intimidation" relied on by the petitioner
as a ground of avoidance of the election fails.

(6) Per Goonewardene J..."in terms of section 91 (a) of the Presidential
Elections Act, an order to avoid an election it must be shown that it was not
a free and fair one. It is proved not to be a free and fair election, when it
is proved that the majority of the electors were or may have been prevented
from electing the

5

candidate whom they preferred ... It is therefore, in my view, vital to the
success of the petitioner's case as based upon section 91 (a) of the
Presidential Elections Act to prove as the primary requisite, that the
majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred".

1st September, 1992.  
**G. P S. DE SILVA, C.J.**

On 09th January, 1989, the petitioner Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike filed this
petition seeking to have the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, the 1st
respondent, to the office of President of Sri Lanka, declared null and void.
The election was held on 19th December, 1988. There were 3 candidates,
Sirimavo R. D. Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), Ranasinghe
Premadasa of the United National Party (UNP) and Oswin Abeygunasekera of the
Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP). The Commissioner of Elections (2nd
respondent) declared the results as follows:

Oswin Abeygunasekera | 235719  |  4.63%  
---|---|---  
Sirimavo Bandaranaike | 2289860   | 44.95%  
Ranasinghe Premadasa  | 2569199  |  50.43%  
Valid votes | 5094778  |  
Rejected votes | 91445  |  
Total polled | 5186223  |  
Majority | 279339  |  
Total registered votes |  9375742  |  
Total polled/registered votes |   |  55.32%

By this petition, the petitioner is challenging the election of the 1st
respondent on the following grounds:

(1) that by reason of general intimidation, the majority of ejectors were or
may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred under
section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 (hereinafter
referred to as the Act);

(2) that by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act relating
to elections, the election was not conducted in accordance with the principles
laid down in such provisions and that such non-compliance affected the result
of the election under s. 91 (b) of the Act;

(3) that by reason of "other circumstances", to wit, the failure of the
Commissioner of Elections (the 2nd respondent), and/or certain members of his
staff to conduct a fair and free election, in accordance with the provisions
of the Act, more particularly set out in paragraph 9 read with paragraph 8 of
the petition, the majority of the electors were or may have been prevented
from electing the candidate whom they preferred, under section 91 (a) of the
Act.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, Counsel for the petitioner, in his closing address
abandoned charge (2) above. Therefore in these proceedings we are now
concerned only with charges (1) and (3) above. The trial commenced on 19th
June, 1989, and concluded on 30th June, 1992\. The petitioner called 546
witnesses, the 1st respondent 399 witnesses, and the 2nd respondent 32
witnesses.

The charge of "general intimidation" as a ground or avoidance of the election
in terms of section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981:

Mr. H. L. de Silva for the petitioner commenced his closing address before us
with the submission:- " There is in fact I venture to submit but one pivotal
question in this case and that turns on the correct interpretation of section
91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act". Section 91 (a) reads as follows:-

9

"The election of a candidate to the office of President shall be declared to
be void on an election petition on any of the following grounds which may be
proved to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court, namely:

(a) that by reason of general bribery, general treating, or general
intimidation, or other misconduct, or other circumstances, whether similar to
those before enumerated or not, the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred."

Mr. de Silva urged that section 91 (a) does no more than reflect the English
Common Law and that this was the position right from the days of the Ceylon
(State Council Elections Order in Council 1931. The section contained the
basic and essential principles of the English Common Law relating to a free
and fair election. This was precisely the submission made by Mr. de Silva at
the hearing before this Court on the preliminary objections (hereinafter
called the preliminary hearing) filed by the 1st and 2nd respondents, moving
for a dismissal of the petition in limine. It was his submission then (as it
was in his closing address) that the expression "general intimidation" is
nowhere defined in the Act and that our Courts have hitherto looked to the
English Common Law for its meaning. The section is intended to protect the
right of the electorate to a free and fair election. The underlying principle
is that it is in the public interest that the election should be free and
fair. In the English Common Law "general intimidation" has a well-recognised
meaning which goes back to the time of Edward III.

In the order made by this Court on the preliminary objection (hereinafter
called the preliminary order) the submissions of Mr. de Silva are set out
thus:

"(1) The English Common Law of a 'free and fair election' is what is embodied
in s. 91 (a). The expression 'majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred' means a majority of
persons entitled to vote free of intimidation and other pressures, were
prevented or may have been prevented from electing a candidate according to
their preferences. **The expression does not Impose an additional**

**10**

**burden on the petitioner**. If general intimidation is established, the
necessary consequence flows - that the majority were prevented from electing
the candidate of their choice. All that the petitioner need establish is
general intimidation. Once general intimidation is established, free choice
goes." (The emphasis is ours)

"(2) In this view of the matter, it is not necessary to identify the candidate
whom the majority of electors would or may have preferred. Moreover, how the
voters would have voted under different circumstances is impossible of proof.
Unlike in the case of the statutory offence of undue influence where there
must be an identification of the individual affected by the intimidation in
the case of general intimidation, the identification of victims is difficult
and is not necessary. Furthermore, it would violate the principle of secrecy
of the ballot which is enshrined in Article 93 of the Constitution which
enacts that 'the voting for the election of the President of the Republic
shall be free, equal and by secret ballot'. A voter cannot be asked for whom
he would have voted, if there was no general intimidation." (1989 1 Sri L. R.
240 at 249 and 250)(1).

The Court then posed to itself the question, "what is the English Common Law
regarding the avoidance of elections?" (at page 255) and having considered no
less than seven cases dealing with the English Common Law, concluded as
follows:

"From the observations made in the said cases, it seems to us to be clear that
at English Common Law, where it was proved that bribery, treating or
intimidation were so general and so extensive in its operation that it
prevented men of ordinary nerve and courage from going to the poll, whether or
not the successful candidate or his agents were responsible for the corruption
or violence, the election was set aside on the ground that it was not free".
(at page 258).

Thereafter the Court considered the rival contentions of Mr. de Silva and Mr
Choksy:-

11

"The question arises whether s. 91 (a) of the Act embodies what Mr. H. L. de
Silva, P.C. described as the "pure and unadulterated English Common Law" prior
to 1949, or as Mr. Choksy submitted, that in addition to general intimidation
etc. something more has to be proved by a petitioner to have an election
avoided under s. 91 (a)." (at page 259)

Having cited the cases of _Illangaratne v. G. E. de Silva_ (2), _Abeywardene v
Ariya Bulegoda_ (3) and Jayasinghe v Jayakody (4) the court expressed its
ruling in the following terms:

"We agree with Mr. Choksy that more proof of the several instances or acts of
general intimidation would not suffice to avoid an election. In addition, the
petitioner has to prove that these several acts or instances had the result or
consequence that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred'." (at page 261)

This is a very important finding in the preliminary order. The Court did not
accept Mr. de Silva's submission that section 91 (a) reflects no more than the
English Common Law. Mr. de Silva contended in his closing address that the
Court was in error in reaching this conclusion. Said Mr. de Silva in his
closing address "... the Supreme Court has misunderstood what the English
Common Law on the subject was and wrongly assumed the requirement of the
English Common Law was different. The language in section 91 (a) is in fact a
reproduction of the English Common Law prior to 1949 and does not introduce an
additional requirement ... What the earlier Bench in the preliminary order
erroneously thought to be "additional" is also as much a part of the English
Law" (written submissions of Mr. de Silva).

The other crucial question which the Court in its preliminary order posed to
itself is, "What is the meaning of the expression 'the majority of electors
were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred?" (at page 264). The Court proceeded to consider several decisions,
viz. _Ratnam v. Dingiri Banda_ (5), _Pelpola v. R. S. S. Gunawardene_ (6)
_Tarnolis Appuhamy v._

12

_  Wilmot Perera _(7), _North Louth case_ (8), _South Meath case_ (9) and
answered the question in the following terms:

"So, it seems to us that on the basis of instances or acts of general
intimidation established by evidence, the Court may draw a reasonable
inference therefrom that the majority of electors may have been prevented from
electing the candidate of their choice. In a case of general intimidation, the
question that arises is - from the proved acts of intimidation of electors, is
it reasonable to suppose that the result of the election may have been
affected? This, it seems to us, to be the true meaning of the words" the
majority of the electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate
they preferred". But, it will be open to the returned candidate to show that
the gross intimidation could not possibly have affected the result of the
election.' (at page 270)

This is a clear, categorical and unequivocal ruling on the key words in
section 91 (a) of the Act. It is confined in terms to a "case of general
intimidation". At the argument on the preliminary objection much time was
spent in elucidating the meaning of these words of critical importance in
section 91 (a). Almost all the cases cited by Mr. de Silva in his closing
address were cited at the hearing on the preliminary objections. A full and
comprehensive argument was presented by both Mr. de Silva and Mr. Choksy. The
argument lasted for as long as 17 days in March and May 1989.

At the preliminary hearing Mr. de Silva strenuously contended that section 91
(a) has two constituent elements. First there must be proof of certain forms
of conduct or events of a specific description - general bribery, general
treating or general intimidation, or other misconduct, or other circumstances,
whether similar to those before enumerated or not. The second limb of the
section - "the majority of the electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred" \- connotes the consequences of
the conduct or the events specified in the first part of the section. The
consequence is to impede or prevent the free exercise of the franchise. The
specified forms of conduct or events, on account of their inherent nature,
impede or prevent the free exercise of the

13

franchise. Once it is established that the general intimidation is of a
widespread and of an all pervasive character (not of a local or isolated
nature) then the inevitable consequence is that the voter's freedom to elect a
candidate of his choice is seriously affected. The effect is in-built in the
very nature of the forms of. conduct or events specifically set out in the
section. The Court will draw an inference as to the effect, having regard to
the nature of the forms of conduct or events enumerated in the section. This
is a matter of legal inference for the Court. In other words what Mr. de Silva
stressed was that the effect or the consequence **is not** an independent
factor or an additional element ("something more" as stated in the preliminary
order). In short, it is not a requirement that has to be proved aliunde. These
submissions, however, did not find acceptance with the Court in the
preliminary order.

Apart from the passages in the preliminary order quoted earlier, the following
passage in that order also shows that the interpretation placed on the section
by Mr. de Silva did not find favour with the Court -

"s.91(a) of the Act states that an election will be avoided if it is 'proved
to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court that by reason of general
intimidation, the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred'. It seems to us that it is for the
petitioner to prove that there was widespread violence directed towards
preventing electors from voting. But the relief which the petitioner has asked
for under s.91(a) of the Act will be granted subject to a finding by the
Supreme Court that the general intimidation had the effect, namely, that the
'majority were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred'. It is a conclusion which is placed in the hands of the
Supreme Court upon a review of all the evidence." (at page 268)

This passage shows that the view of the Court was that proof of widespread
violence directed towards preventing electors from voting was not enough.
There was the requirement of proof of an additional and distinct ingredient of
the charge. Relief which the petitioner has asked for under section 91 (a) of
the Act will be granted

14

subject to a finding by the Supreme Court that the general intimidation had
the requisite effect. In the preliminary order the Court cited with approval
the opinion of Sharvananda, C.J. in _Jayasinghe v. Jayakody_ (4) - "in order
to succeed in his petition the petitioner has got to prove a **further
ingredient** , viz. that the majority of the electors may have been prevented
from electing the candidate whom they preferred ..." (The emphasis is ours)

On the other hand, it was the submission of Mr. de Silva that the second limb
of s.91(a) was not intended to impose an additional requirement but it
indicates the effect flowing from the "general intimidation". At the
preliminary hearing it was the contention of Mr. de Silva that the section
postulates "a composite concept" and the latter part of the section sets out
"the necessary effect of the unlawful pressures" (to use Counsel's own words).
In his closing address Mr. de Silva urged that "by considering this last
element to be an addition the Court has unwittingly fallen into error and
thought that the Sri Lankan law on this question was in some way different
from the English Common Law. That this is not so may be gathered from the
unambiguous statement of Nagalingam, J. when he stated the law in _Tarnolis
Appuhamy v WiImot Perera_ (7) There is not even a hint there that our law is
any different from the English Common Law - there is no such additional
element." (Written submissions of Mr. de Silva).

We have already referred to the ruling in the preliminary order (1989 1 Sri
L.R. at 270) as to the meaning of the key words "the majority of electors were
or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred".
Mr. de Silva strongly urged before us that the word "result" when used "in the
judicial exposition of s.91(a) means 'the effect' or 'the consequence' which
the offensive acts have on the majority of voters' freedom to choose the
candidate ... Courts have for convenience, in order to describe the requisite
magnitude or the extent to which voters were prevented from voting used the
expression 'that the result may have been affected' as a shorthand expression
for describing the extent or magnitude of the affectation. But these words are
not in fact to be found in the words enacted by Parliament in framing para (a)
of s.91. That is only a judicial paraphrase of paragraph (a) ... These words
prescribe the

15

index or the measure of the effect which the law requires the prohibited acts
or disabling facts must have on the minds of the voters". (Written submissions
of Mr. de Silva)

It appears to us, however, there is not even a hint in the preliminary order
that the Court was resorting to what Mr. de Silva calls a "judicial
paraphrase" of s.91 (a) when the Court ruled that "in a case of general
intimidation, the question that arises is - from the proved acts of
intimidation of electors, is it reasonable to suppose that the **result of the
election may have been affected "**. It is not without significance that in
the very next sentence the Court proceeded to say in clear, explicit and
emphatic terms, "this it seems to. us, to be the true meaning of the words
'the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate
they preferred'." Undoubtedly the ruling is in terms that are cogent, precise
and unambiguous. There is nothing whatever to suggest in this ruling that the
words "prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred" mean more
than saying "prevented from freely exercising the franchise or the right to
vote" as contended for by Mr. de Silva.

The expression "result of the election" which occurs in the above ruling of
the Court has to-be given its plain and literal meaning, for there is no other
meaning which could be reasonably attributed, having regard to the rival
contentions advanced and the context in which the words are used. Mr. de Silva
strongly relied on the fact that in the preliminary order the Court expressly
held that the "result" contemplated in s.91(b) is "the success of one
candidate over the other" citing Woodword v. Sarsons (10) but that the Court
made no such ruling in respect of its analysis of s.91(a). This, however, does
not mean that the Court used the words "result of the election" in a sense
other than its natural and ordinary meaning, namely, **the outcome** of the
election.

Mr. de Silva drew our attention to two submissions made by Mr. Choksy for the
1st respondent in support of the preliminary objections. These submissions are
set out in the preliminary order (1989) 1 Sri L.R. 240 at 248, and read as
follows:-

16

"(1) The petitioner must prove that by reason of general intimidation, a
certain result or consequence followed, namely, that 'the majority of electors
were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred'. This is an important ingredient of the ground of avoidance in
s.91(a) of the Act. If so, the petitioner must identify the candidate whom the
majority of electors preferred, but were or may have been prevented from
electing by reason of general intimidation.

This is a material fact which the petitioner must prove and if it is a
material fact to be proved, then it must be pleaded."

"(2) In addition, the petitioner must plead and prove how the majority of
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred. That is, the petitioner must plead and prove that the majority of
electors who voted for the 1st respondent were or may have been compelled to
vote for him by reason of general intimidation, or that the balance 45% of the
electors abstained from voting because of general intimidation, and if they
had voted, the reasonable probabilities are that they would have voted for
her. This is a material fact which the petitioner must prove, and if so it
must be pleaded".

It was the contention of Mr. de Silva that both submissions were rejected by
the Court in the preliminary order. We do not agree. This is how the Court in
its preliminary order dealt with (1) above - (1989) 1 Sri L.R. 240 at 263.

"s.96(c) of the Act requires that the petition 'shall contain a concise
statement of the material facts on which the petitioner relies'. In
_Wijewardena v. Senanayake_ ,(11) H. N. G. Fernando, C.J. observed that this
requirement was 'intended to secure that a respondent will know from the
petition Itself what facts the petitioner proposes to prove in order to avoid
the election and will thus have a proper opportunity to prepare for the trial
... The term 'material facts' has a plain meaning in the context of
requirements relating to pleadings, namely, facts material to

establish a party's case'. The object of the requirement is clearly to enable
the opposite party to prepare his case for the trial so that he may not be
taken by surprise. When the petitioner pleaded in paragraph 6(a) of her
petition that 'there was general intimidation in consequence of which the
majority of the said electors were or may have been prevented from electing
the candidate whom they preferred' is there sufficient information given in
the petition to enable the 1st respondent to identify the candidate whom the
electors were or may have been prevented from electing? In paragraph (1), the
petitioner has stated that she was a candidate at the Presidential Election
and 'claims to have had a right to be returned or elected at the said
election'. The petitioner has set out in paragraph 5 the votes cast for each
candidate and that she obtained the second largest number of votes. Could
there be any doubt in the mind of the 1st respondent as to the identity of the
candidate, who, the petitioner claims, would or may have been returned but for
the general intimidation?"

There is no finding here that it is not necessary for the petitioner to
identify the candidate whom the majority of electors preferred but were or may
have been prevented from electing by reason of general intimidation. All that
the Court held was that on a fair reading of the relevant averments in the
petition, the test formulated in Wijewardena v. Senanayake (supra) was
satisfied. In other words the pleadings were sufficient to prevent the
opposite party from being taken by surprise. There is certainly no finding by
the Court, that the petitioner is relieved of the obligation to show that she
was the candidate whom the majority of electors may have preferred but for the
intimidation.

As regards (2) above, the Court having held that the petitioner's case is one
of "preventive intimidation" (and not "coercive intimidation") and having
considered Rutnam's case, Pelpola's case, Wilmot Perera's case (supra) and the
observation of Gibson J. in the _North Louth Case_ (8) and of O' Brien J. in
South Meath Case (supra) reached the following finding:- "In Our opinion, how
the majority were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate of
their choice need not be **specially** pleaded" \- at page 268. (The emphasis
is ours) In other words the Court was of the view that a

18

 specific or an express plea was not necessary and the plea in the petition in
regard to the effect of the general intimidation was adequate. We cannot agree
that this finding has any further implication in regard to the ingredients of
the charge of general intimidation set out in s.91 (a).

The preliminary order has dealt in fair detail with the two local cases
relating to a charge of general intimidation, viz. Ratnam v. Dingiri Banda and
Pelpola v. R. S. S. Gunawardene (supra). These two cases are important
inasmuch as they indicate the approach of the Court to the facts in relation
to the requirement of "affectation" of the result. In Ratnam's case the
contention of the petitioner was that his supporters who were the Indian
labourers on the estates were prevented from going to the poll by the
supporters of the contesting candidate, M. D. Banda. Upon a review of the
evidence Hearne J. expressed his finding in the following terms:- "I hold that
there was gross intimidation, that it was widespread in the areas where **Mr.
Ratnam had good reason, to count upon heavy voting In his favour,** and that
it may well have prevented the majority of the electors from returning the
candidate whom they preferred". The words underlined above show that upon the
evidence the Court found that there were areas within the electorate where the
majority of the electors were supporters of the petitioner, though of course
they were prevented from going to the poll. In a narrow and unduly strict
sense it could be said that this finding was reached on "opinion evidence".
Nevertheless the ultimate conclusion in favour of Ratnam was reached on the
basis that the intimidation was widespread "in the areas where Mr. Ratnam had
good reason to count upon heavy voting in his favour ....." If Mr. de Silva is
correct in his submission that such evidence is opinion evidence and
inadmissible hearsay, then Hearne J. could not have found for the petitioner.

Pelpola's case was also a similar case where the Court specifically addressed
its mind to the pattern of "voter behaviour". Apart from the fact that the
majority of the winning candidate was only 387 votes, the unchallenged
position of the -petitioner was that over one quarter of the electorate were
Indian estate labourers **against whom the intimidation was directed.** There
was the evidence of the President of the Ceylon Indian Congress Labour Union
Committee of Mosville

19

Estate that all the Indian labourers had decided to vote for the petitioner.
Windham, J. goes on to state: "It is not unreasonable to suppose that the
Indian labourers on the neighbouring estates ... had likewise decided to vote
for the petitioner ... Only 514 out of 1427 recorded their votes at the
Uduwela polling station ... Had 400 more persons voted and cast their votes
for the petitioner the latter would have won the election". (The emphasis is
ours) Thus it is seen that the decision turned not only on the size of the
majority but also on (1) the direction of the intimidation (acts of
intimidation against the Indian estate labourers), (2) the probability of the
Indian estate labourers voting for the petitioner. In other words, the Court
considered the evidence relating to the charge of general intimidation on the
basis of how the electors may have voted had they the opportunity of voting -
a view of the evidence which Mr. de Silva strongly urged a Court is precluded
by law from taking by reason of the secrecy provisions. These provisions no
doubt preclude an elector who has voted from being asked for whom he voted.
But do they also preclude a witness who claims to be an organizer or an
office-bearer of a party branch from stating that the campaign of a candidate
was disrupted by certain incidents and that the supporters of that candidate
were afraid to go to the poll? We think not. It is very relevant to note that
in both Ratnam's case and Pelpola's case evidence of the party affiliation of
the voters in relation to the petitioner was considered and acted upon by the
Court. Similar secrecy provisions in regard to the ballot were in operation at
that time also, but the evidence was admitted. What is relevant for present
purposes is that evidence of party affiliation was allowed as a mode of proof
that the voters were prevented from electing the candidate of their choice.

Mr. de Silva vigorously contended that the evidence led on behalf of the 1st
respondent of adverse "affectation" of UNP supporters by reason of the JVP
terror campaign was based on pure conjecture and speculation; that the Court
is precluded from considering such evidence as it is founded on surmise and
unpredictable factors. We find, however, that the case for the petitioner,
**as presented before us** , was not free of evidence of this kind. A striking
example was the evidence of the principal witness for the Anuradhapura
electoral district, K. B. Ratnayake.M.P. He said he was the authorised agent
of the petitioner for Anuradhapura (East) at the Presidential Election. In
examination-in-chief he was questioned as follows:-

20

Q. Did you expect more votes than what you received at the Presidential
election of 1987?

A. Yes.

Q. About how many votes did you expect?

A. I expected a minimum of another 20,000 more votes from my electorate alone.

Q. For what reasons did you expect more votes?

A. After the defeat in 1977 we organized branches and formed women's
organizations, youth organizations and enrolled members. We had more than 120
branches in my division alone and there were 8000 registered members and one
member from each household generally.

Q. Roughly, how many votes were there in support of the SLFP?

A. Two or three from each family.

Q. Were there any other reasons why you expected more votes to the SLFP?

A. In addition to the organizational strength there was unpopularity on the
part of the government party because people could not get what they wanted;
due to communal issues there were several killings near the Jayasrimaha Bodhi.
This position was aggravated by the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord.

Q. Are there any other reasons?

A. No.

Q. How many more votes did you expect in the entire district?

A. We expected at least another two lakhs more in the Anuradhapura district.

Similarly Pradeep Hapangama, M.P. for the Gampaha district testified to the
"enthusiasm among the people for the SLFP in the Mahara electorate"; that he
enrolled 4000 members and established about 100 SLFP party branches; that
after the attack on the meeting organized by the USA at Kadawata junction on
01.12.88 there was a change in the enthusiasm among the people to work for the
SLFP. There was also the evidence of R. M. Jayasena, M.P. for the Kurunegala
district who stated that he formed 184 SLFP branches and enrolled about 15300
members for the 1988 Presidential

21

election. There was the evidence of witness Pina of Yapahuwa who claimed that
of the 182 voters in his village all except 2 were members of the local branch
of the SLFP of which he was the president. There is also the evidence of Dr.
Neville Fernando, M.P. for the Kalutara district. In examination-in-chief he
stated as follows:

Q. You said you expected a very high poll?

A. Yes, but they did not turn up.

Q. Is that the reason for the petitioner to get 28,000 votes?

A. Yes.

Q. Otherwise she would. have got over 40,000 votes?

A. Yes.

Q. She received only 28,000 votes?

A. I expected that Mrs. Bandaranaike would get over 40,000 votes.

Q. That was the result of this intimidation caused by the shooting that took
place?

A. Yes.

This kind of evidence was led to show that in certain electorates the SLFP had
strong support but that the acts of intimidation prevented the party
supporters from votng on 19.12.88. The inference to be drawn from the evidence
is that but for the violence the SLFP would have received more votes.

There is a further aspect to Mr. de Silva's submission that the Court is
precluded from acting upon the evidence led on behalf of the 1st respondent.
When Mr. Choksy moved to lead evidence on behalf of the 1st respondent at the
conclusion of the evidence led on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. de Silva
vehemently opposed it. It was the submission of Mr. de Silva that evidence of
incidents outside what is pleaded in the petition is totally irrelevant to the
issues that arise in this case. Such evidence could, if at all, only
strengthen the case for the petitioner on the charge of general intimidation.
Mr. de Silva analysed the constituent elements of s.91 (a) and we find the
submissions he made then were substantially the same as the submissions he
made before us in his closing address. On the other hand, Mr. Choksy argued
that he was entitled to lead evidence of intimidation directed against the
supporters of the UNP and his case

22

was that such intimidation contributed to the low poll at the Presidential
election. Upon a consideration of the submissions made by Mr. de Silva and Mr.
Choksy, this Court made order on 18.12.90 overruling the objection taken on
behalf of the petitioner. In allowing Mr. Choksy to lead evidence of incidents
outside the petition this Court made specific reference to the "order we have
already delivered in regard to the preliminary objection that was taken at the
commencement of these proceedings".

The order made by this Court on the preliminary objections is clearly binding
on us, although Mr. de Silva argued that some of the crucial findings therein
are erroneous. Having regard to the nature of the preliminary objections that
were raised, the Court was called upon to analyse the ingredients of the
charge of general intimidation postulated in s. 91 (a). At the hearing on the
preliminary objections the foundation of the submissions of Mr. de Silva was
that s. 91 (a) embodied the essential principles of the English Common Law
relating to a free and fair election. The Court did not accept this
contention. The Court ruled on what it considered to be the true meaning of
the words "... the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred". This ruling is undoubtedly a part
of the ratio decidendi of the order and it is not open to us to place a gloss
on it or to deviate from it. What is more, we cannot overlook the significant
fact that the trial proceeded on the basis of the interpretation placed by the
Court on s. 91 (a) in the preliminary order.

One of the important contentions of Mr. de Silva both at the stage when he
objected to evidence being led on behalf of the 1st respondent and also in his
closing address was that any evidence of an opinion expressed by a witness (be
he an office-bearer of a local party branch, a political activist, a local
organizer or even an ordinary member of a local branch) as to how others who
are supporters of the party would vote is inadmissible for such opinion is
based on pure conjecture, surmise and speculation. No one could predict how an
elector who could not vote might have voted. In support of this proposition
Mr. de Silva relied strongly on a passage from the judgment in Shiv Charan
_Singh v. Chandra Bhan Singh and Others_ (12)and on the observation of Grove
.J in the _Hacknev Case_ (13)

which were cited in the preliminary order (1989 1 Sri L.R. 240 at 269 and
270). The passage that was cited in the preliminary order from **Shiv Charan
Singh's** case reads as follows:

"The burden to prove this material effect (on the result of the election) is
difficult and many times it is almost impossible to produce the requisite
proof. Electors exercise their right to vote on various unpredictable
considerations, and the Courts are ill-equipped to speculate, guess or
forecast by proceeding on probabilities or drawing inferences regarding the
conduct of thousands of voters ...". (1989 1 Sri L.R. at 269)

The observation of Grove J. in the Hackney Case cited in the preliminary order
reads thus:

"I cannot see how the Tribunal can by any possibility say, what would or might
have taken place under different circumstances. It seems to me a problem which
the human mind has not yet been able to solve, namely, if things had been
different at a certain period, what would have been the result of the
concatenation of events upon the supposed change of circumstances ... " (1989
1 Sri L.R. 270)

The point that is relevant and must be noted is that the Court in the
preliminary order cited these two passages when considering the meeting of the
expression "were or may have been prevented" in s.91 (a). The court was at
pains to point out the significant difference between the words "were" and
"may have been". This is manifest from the reasoning of the Court which
appears just before the quotation from **Shiv Charan Singh's** Case. The Court
reasoned thus:- "It seems to us that the term 'may' was designedly used
because mathematical proof that the majority of electors were in fact
prevented, in many a case, is impossible of attainment. The burden to prove
that the majority of electors were in fact prevented is difficult and it is
almost impossible to produce the requisite proof". (1989 1 Sri L.R. 269) (1).
We cannot agree with Mr. de Silva that there is anything in the preliminary
order which precludes us from considering the evidence led on behalf of the
1st respondent of acts

24

of intimidation against his supporters. Indeed the Court overruled this very
objection and allowed the 1st respondent to lead such evidence. That order
made in these very proceedings is clearly binding on us. As stated earlier,
both in Ratnam's case and Pelpola's case the Supreme Court acted upon similar
evidence. As submitted by Mr. Choksy, it was evidence of group leaders of
voters that was adduced by the petitioners and acted upon by the Court. And it
was on the basis of that kind of evidence that the Court set aside the
election in these two cases.

Furthermore, in the preliminary order the Court held that one of the essential
ingredients of the charge of "non-compliance" set out in s.91 (b) is that the
"result of the election should be affected". At the preliminary hearing Mr. de
Silva argued the contrary, but in view of the ruling of the Court Counsel very
properly conceded that he cannot maintain the "non-compliance" charge and
abandoned it. The resulting position is that in so far as a charge under s. 91
(b) is concerned a Court must reach a finding as to whether the
"noncompliance" affected the result of the election. A Court then must
consider the question whether the petitioner would have succeeded but for "the
non-compliance". For that purpose evidence of party affiliations would be
relevant and admissible, notwithstanding the secrecy provisions. Would it then
be reasonable to say that the secrecy provisions do not apply to s. 91 (b) but
that they apply to s.91 (a)? We think not.

Before we conclude the discussion of the interpretation of s.91 (a) we think
it fit and proper to observe that the construction sought to be placed on s.91
(a) by Mr. de Silva is not without attraction. However, there is a definite
ruling made by this Court in these same proceedings, after a full argument, a
ruling which runs counter to the submissions of Mr. de Silva as we have
endeavoured to show. It is scarcely necessary to repeat that this ruling is
clearly binding on us.

The facts in relation to the charge of "general intimidation".

We now turn to the facts as presented by the petitioner and the 1st respondent
in respect of the charge of general intimidation. We will consider the
averments in the petition, the evidence led in support

25

thereof by the petitioner, and the evidence adduced by the 1st respondent in
respect of each electoral district as set out in the petition.

**Electoral District No. 01 - Colombo**

Eleven incidents have been pleaded in the petition. The petitioner led
evidence in regard to all incidents except the one pleaded in paragraph 7 (i)
(g). It is unnecessary to burden this order with details of the evidence given
by the several witnesses since Mr. Choksy did not challenge these incidents.
It is averred in paragraph (i) (a) that a large number of voters at two
polling stations were forcibly prevented from voting but the evidence does not
bear out this allegation. The other incidents related to bomb explosions at 4
polling stations; the chief SLFP organizer for Dehiwela was shot at on
17.12.88; explosion of bombs at the SLFP branch at Woodlands Mawatha in the
Dehiwela polling division on 19.12.88; the disruption of the meeting at
Belekkade junction in the Ratmalana polling division on 16.12.88 by the
explosion of bombs when the petitioner was about to address the meeting; 3
persons were killed and 30 injured when bombs were flung at a meeting held on
17.11.88 at Grandpass in support of Mr. Ossie Abeygunasekera.

Mr. Choksy stressed that the evidence did not disclose the killing of any SLFP
organizer or supporter. There are 574 polling stations in the Colombo
electoral district but the evidence of incidents was confined to 7 polling
stations.

As against this evidence, the 1st respondent led evidence of numerous
killings, attacks, and threats of UNP organizers, office bearers of party
branches and of supporters in the following polling divisions:- Colombo
Central, Colombo North, Homagama, Avissawella, Kolonnawa, Moratuwa, Kotte,
Kesbewa, Kaduwela and Maharagama. A very large number of these incidents took
place from about mid-September 1988. About 26 office-bearers of local party
branches were killed and 87 were attacked. A large number received threatening
letters and were compelled to put up banners announcing their resignation from
the offices they held in the party branches. They had no alternative but to
refrain from engaging in any

26

political work. Several witnesses produced the threatening letters they had
received. Some of the documents, purporting to be from the JVP, stated that
the UNP was a party that was banned. (vide 1 R 42 and 1 R 43) Some of the
Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS) members who were active in the election
campaign were killed and some were attacked. It is in evidence that JSS
members actively supported the UNP in the election campaign. It is unnecessary
to consider in detail these anti-UNP incidents because the incidents as such
were not challenged in cross-examination.

**Electoral District No. 02 - Garnpaha**

Paragraph (ii) (a) of the petition speaks of an attack on the Dharma Salawa
polling station No. 27 in the Gampaha polling division on 19.12.88 by a gang
of unknown persons. This incident was not disputed by Mr. Choksy.

Paragraph (ii) (b) alleges that unknown persons threw hand bombs at the
Ganegoda polling station in the Mirigama polling division. There is no
evidence to establish this incident. According to Police Sergeant
Hettiarachchi no incident took place at the polling station on the polling
day. All that happened was that on the night of 18.12.88 while he was on
patrol duty he heard a "loud sound" about 50 yards away from the polling
station and he fired in that direction. We accordingly hold that this incident
has not been proved.

Paragraph (ii) (c) The incident averred is the throwing of bombs at a meeting
held at Kadawata on 1st December 1988 in support of Mr. Ossie Abeygunasekera.
Four persons were killed and some others were injured. The incident is
admitted. As a result of this incident "a large number of people lost their
enthusiasm to work for the SLFP".

There are 13 polling divisions in the Gampaha electoral district. Three
incidents in 3 polling divisions are pleaded in the petition. While there are
717 polling stations in the electoral district, the petitioner complains of
incidents only at 2 polling stations. There is no allegation of any incident
directed against the SLFP. As far as the case for the petitioner is concerned,
the evidence of general intimidation in this electoral district is weak.

27

The case for the 1st respondent, however, stands on a different footing. L. P.
Julis, a strong UNP supporter in Dompe who was to have functioned as a polling
agent on 19.12.88 was shot dead in his house on 18.12.88; Anthony Almeida,
President JSS, Ja-Ela depot, was shot and killed on 14.11.88 at his residence;
Hubert Silva, Chief Organizer, Ragama, and President UNP branch Ragama was
shot dead on 18.1 1.B8 at this house; S. M. Gunadasa, President JSS, Veyangoda
Mills, was killed on 19.11.88. About 9 office-bearers of UNP branches were
killed from about mid-September 1988. There were as many as 133 resignations
of members of the UNP branches as well as from membership of the JSS on
account of threats received from the JVP. Some of these persons were compelled
to announce their resignations by inserting advertisements in the newspapers -
vide 1 R 57A, 1 R 5713, 1 R 52A, 1 R 55A, and 1 R 54A.

Mathew Perera a member of the Western Provincial Council produced the letter 1
R 58. This letter reads thus: "Resignation from offices". "It is an act of
treachery to serve the traitorous UNP - Thondaman Government that has betrayed
the nation to the Indian imperialists ... Therefore you are hereby ordered to
resign forthwith from all the offices you hold. Penalty for defying this order
is death. No further notice will be given". There is a postscript which reads:
"The UNP is a prohibited party. It is an act of treachery to carry on their
propaganda activities ...".

**Electoral District No. 03 - Kalutara**

The petitioner has pleaded 10 instances of intimidation and has led evidence
in respect of 9. The petitioner has also pleaded posters threatening voters in
the Agalawatte polling division.

Paragraph (iii) (a) alleges that an SLMP supporter Rev. Premaloka was shot
dead at Panadura on 19th December 1988. This incident is not challenged.

The averment in paragraph (iii) (b) that a female voter who was on her way to
the polling station on 19.12.88 was shot dead is not challenged. Nor is the
allegation in paragraph (iii) (c) that a voter at Agalawatte was shot and
injured disputed.

28

The incident pleaded in **paragraph (iii) (d)** is of a very serious nature,
and would undoubtedly have deterred many SLFP supporters from going to the
poll. It refers to the shooting incident at the house of Dr. Neville Fernando
on 18.12.88 at about 10.30 a.m. Eight persons were killed and several were
injured consequent upon the shooting.

The item pleaded in **paragraph (iii) (e)** reads as follows:- "A bomb was
exploded near the Kaluwamodera polling station No. 43 in Beruwala polling
division on 18th December 1988\. Roads around polling stations were blocked
and Junior Presiding Officers and clerks did not report for duty". We find
that there is no evidence of a bomb explosion near the Kaluwamodera polling
station. Nor is there evidence that Junior Presiding Officers and clerks did
not report for duty. We are satisfied that the incident has not been proved.

In regard to **paragraph (iii) (f)** there is, evidence of a bomb explosion
near the Andewela polling station No. 30 in the Matugama polling division on
19th December 1988 at about 2 p.m. Voting was suspended for about 15 minutes
and went on till 4 p.m. There is, however, no evidence that the explosion
caused roads to be blocked.

**Paragraph (iii) (g)** alleges that the Senior Presiding Officer at Gammana
polling station No. 06 in the Agalawatte polling division was shot at and
injured in the early hours of the. day of the poll, and that several bombs
were thrown? near the polling station. The evidence of the two witnesses
called by the petitioner, namely, Seneviratne and Amerasena does not establish
this allegation.

As against this the 1st respondent has led evidence of the killing of about 15
office-bearers of party branches in the Kalutara electoral district from about
mid-September 1988. There is the evidence of two strong UNP supporters being
killed at Agalawatte on 09.12.88. On 28.11.88 G. Wijesena, Secretary JSS
Tibbotuwa branch was killed at his house at night. D. Pathirage, a political
activist in Bulathsinghala was shot dead on 10.12.88, as a bundle of UNP
manifestos was discovered in his house. H. de Silva, a member of the UNP
branch at Waskaduwa North was shot dead on 21.11.88. As a result of this

29

killing all members of the Waskaduwa North party branch resigned and put up
banners. Martin Vithanage, an active JSS member was shot and stabbed to death
on 08.11.88 in the Matugama polling division. After the killing a poster was
found by the road stating that UNP traitors and stooges are punished with
death. His widow and children left the village and did not vote. On 18.12.88
there was a bomb explosion outside the house of Upali Wijekoon, a brother of
the President of the local party branch. There were at that time 15 - 20 UNP
supporters inside the house. On 19.12.88 20 Tamil estate workers on Delkeith
estate in the Agalawatte polling division were intimidated and they did not
cast their votes. Anthony Cooray, Vice-President of the UNP Balamandalaya at
Beruwela stated in evidence that there were 300 voters at St. Vincent's Home
and 90% of them supported the UNP At the Presidential election, however, only
6 votes were cast.

**Electoral District No. 04 - Kandy**

In the Kandy electoral district there are 13 polling divisions and 580 polling
stations. The petitioner relies on one incident:- Shots were fired by unknown
gunmen at voters who had gone to vote at Deliwalatenne. polling station (No.
24) in the Kundasale polling division on 19th December 1988. The incident is
admitted. Further it is not disputed that the voters were SLFP supporters and
that they were unable to cast their votes.

The examination-in-chief of the witness P. Karunadasa called by the petitioner
to speak to the incident is of relevance in view of Mr. de Silva's submission
in regard to the provisions of law relating to the secrecy of the ballet.
Karunadasa was injured by the shooting.

Q. Have you been a supporter of any political party?

A. No. I am a voter of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

Q. You said you gave support by voting?

A. Yes.

Q. For which party?

A. It was Sri Lanka party.

Q. What party, what was the symbol?

A. Hand, The leader is Mrs. Bandaranaike.

30

Q. From when were you a supporter?

A. From 1965 I am a supporter of that party.

Q. You said there were 6 persons who went along with you?

A. Yes, along with me.

Q. Did the others discuss with you where they were going?

A. We all were going to the polling booth.

Q. Did you know to which party they were supporting?

A. Yes, Sri Lanka Freedom Party.

In regard to the submission of Mr. de Silva that the party affiliation of
voters is irrelevant, the evidence of witness Dambakotuwa (the SLFP organizer
for Kundasale) was that this shooting incident affected voters at other
polling stations as well.

Q. After you visited Karunadasa at the hospital did you again go round your
electorate?

A. Yes.

Q. You visited the polling stations?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you observe at these polling stations?

A. After getting the information of shooting at Delivalatenna supporters of
the SLFP were frightened to come to the polling stations to cast their vote.

Q. Was it only SLFP supporters who were frightened to come and vote because of
this incident?

A. Mostly.

It is not without significance that the shooting was at SLFP supporters, and
the evidence was that it affected mostly SLFP supporters at the other polling
stations as well. The extent of the "affectation" is seen from this evidence.

As against this single incident pleaded in the petition the 1st respondent has
led evidence of the killing of about 11 office-bearers and of about 26 other
supporters from about mid-September 1988. On 16.12.88 Sarath and Sisira
Subawickrema (brothers) were taken out of their house and shot and killed.
Sisira was the Secretary of the local UNP branch and Sarath was a member of
the branch. On

31

13.11.88 one Dhanapala a strong UNP supporter was killed. These incidents
occurred at the Galegedera polling division. On 07.11.88 Nazeer Jamal, a UNP
supporter was shot and killed at his boutique near the Kandy railway station.
On 15.12.88 two organizers in two different local areas in the Kundasale
polling division (E. N. Gunawardena and D. R.. Jayawardene) were killed. On
the same day a UNP supporter named Kingsley Jayawardene was killed. On the
night of 18.12.88 3 persons named Najeem, Mani and Nisamdeen who were putting
up posters and distributing pamphlets for the UNP were assaulted and had to be
taken to hospital. On the same day R. W. Vidurusinghe, Secretary of the branch
at Putuhapuwa was shot and killed. In the Nawalapitiya polling division on
16.11.88 there was an attempt to kill H. L. P. Tillakaratne, Chairman,
Nawalapitiya Urban Council and a staunch UNP worker. Three other UNP
supporters who had helped in constructing the stage for a public meeting on
15.11.88 at Nawalapitiya were shot and killed on 16.11.88.

It is in evidence that Tamil workers at Craighead and Monte Cristo estates (in
the Nawalapitiya polling division) who were members of the CWC (and who were
instructed by the Union to vote for the UNP) were assaulted between 10 and 11
a.m. on 19.12.88 and thus prevented from voting. In the Senkadagala polling
division 5 persons engaged in putting up posters for the UNP were cut with
swords and killed on 18.12.88. H. E. Sumathipala, President of the UNP branch,
Morayaya, in the Udu Dumbara polling division was shot and killed on 14.11.88.
R. M. Gunathilleke, President of the UNP branch at Telagune in the same
polling division was killed on 14.12.88. A UNP meeting at Wattappola in the
polling division of Udunuwara was disrupted on 13.12.88 and on the following
day Kuda Banda, the President of the UNP branch at Wattappola was killed.

Kamala Randeniya (Secretary of the Kantha Samithiya, Muruthalawa branch in the
Yatinuwara polling division) and her husband received threatening letters
directing them to resign from all posts held by them in the UNP. On 13.11.88
her brother was killed. Thereafter she and her husband put up posters in front
of their house. One such poster dated 15.11.88 marked 1 R 71 was produced. It
reads thus:- "We Chandrapala Randeniya and Kamala Randeniya of No. 86 A,
Muruthalawa hereby inform the patriotic comrades under oath that effective
from 01.11.88 both of us have resigned from

32

membership and other offices in the UNP and from offices in other
organizations and that we will not participate in any political activity
whatsoever hereafter".

G. R. Abeysundera, M.P. for the Kandy district stated that during the 1988
Presidential election campaign there were numerous killings of UNP supporters
in the Yatinuwara polling division. Further there were threats against persons
working for the UNP. A number of them resigned from the party and refrained
from election work. It was his evidence that as a result of the threats the
party activities in the electorate came to a complete standstill. It was not
possible to go out canvassing and only a few supporters were willing to
function as polling agents.

**Electoral District No. 05 - Matale**

Matale electoral district has 4 polling divisions - Matale, Dambulla, Laggala,
and Rattota. The total number of polling stations is 170\. The petitioner has
pleaded 11 incidents and has led evidence on 10 incidents. The petitioner has
pleaded threatening posters in all 4\. polling divisions.

**Paragraph (v) (a)** This relates to the attack on the house of the SLFP
organizer for Rattota on the night of the 18th of December 1988\. This was an
incident of a very grave nature. Six persons in the house were killed
including the SLFP organizer Wegodapola. The incident was not challenged. It
would undoubtedly have frightened voters, particularly the SLFP supporters
whose organizer was killed on the eve of polling day.

**Paragraph (v) (b)** The Madawala Ulpotha polling station was attacked on
19.12.88 while voting was going on and 4 voters were killed. The SPO closed
the poll by 12 noon owing to the shooting. The incident is admitted but
evidence was led on behalf of the 1 st respondent that the voters killed were
UNP supporters.

**Paragraph (v) (c)** No evidence was led in support of the allegation that
the Galewela polling station in Dambulla polling division was attacked.

33

**Paragraph (v) (d)** The allegation here in that the Kalundawe polling
station (No. 40) in the Dambulla polling division was attacked on 19.12.88
while voting was going on and that 2 voters were injured. There is no evidence
that the polling station was attacked - vide the evidence of V G. Wijekoon
Banda. No officer who functioned at the polling station was called. We hold
that this incident has not been proved.

**Paragraph (v) (e)** It is alleged that the Elamalpotha polling station
(No.18) in the Dambulla polling division was attacked on 19.12.88. The
evidence does not support this allegation - vide the evidence of S. M.
Imamdeen who admitted that the polling station was not attacked. We
accordingly hold that this incident has not been established.

**Paragraph (v) (f)** The murder on 17.12.88 of the SLFP organizer for
Dambulla, T. B. Kulatunga, was not challenged. Mr. Choksy submitted that
Kulatunga's office was a very small one, consisting of only 2 rooms, one of
which was used as a boutique. Counsel also stressed that the office was
situated by a gravel road in Galahitiyagama which is a small village on the
border of Dambulla polling division. These circumstances do not, however,
detract from the important fact that Kulatunga was the SLFP organizer for
Dambulla and his murder on the eve of the election would undoubtedly have
driven fear into the minds of the voters, particularly the SLFP supporters. At
one stage of the cross-examination, the fact that Kulatunga was the organizer
was challenged but later this was not pursued.

**Paragraph (v) (g)** The burning of the office of the SLFP at Walawela on
13.12.88 was not disputed. This would have had an adverse effect on the SLFP
campaign.

**Paragraph (v) (h)** The throwing of bombs at the SLFP main office in the
Matale town on 16.12.88 at 5 a.m. was also not challenged. This too was an
incident which would have affected SLFP supporters.

**Paragraph (v) (i)** The shooting on 09.12.88 of the President of the SLFP
branch at Aluthgama, is not challenged. This incident would have had an
adverse impact on the SLFP supporters.

34

**Paragraph (v) (i)** The averment here is that:- "posters appeared before the
election day warning people not to vote for the SLFP". The evidence of C. W.
Abeyratne shows that in Madipola in the Dambulla polling division posters
appeared stating "death for supporters of the SLFP". The witness Chandawimala
Thera said he saw posters which read "Refrain from voting for the SLFP" in 4
places in the Matale polling division. There is also the evidence of Haniffa
Hadjiar to the same effect. We hold that the averment in paragraph (j) has
been proved.

**Paragraph (v) (k)** It is averred here that gangs of unknown persons went
from house to house warning persons not to vote. The evidence of O. W.
Abeyratne, Upatissa Banda, D. D. Kannangara and Chandawimala Thera establishes
this fact.

On a consideration of the above evidence we hold that there was considerable
intimidation directed at the SLFP supporters in the Matale electoral district
as a result of the killing of 2 SLFP organizers, the attacks on 2 SLFP
offices, and the posters specifically warning people not to vote for the SLFP

The 1st respondent led evidence of resignations of office-bearers in the local
party branches and of a very large number of JSS members who were compelled to
resign on account of death threats. District Secretary of the JSS (Central
Province) Sydney de Soysa said in his evidence that there were about 2500
workers in the 6 C.T.B. depots that fall within the district and that 2150 are
members of the JSS. Premasiri, the President of the JSS, Matale depot was shot
at in November 1988 and the result was that the election work done by the JSS
came to a standstill. Practically all the office-bearers of the 6 depots
resigned from their posts. He was questioned as to the kind of political work
done by the JSS members during elections. His answer was, "They assist in
fixing posters, if there is to be a rally, they help to construct the stage;
we organize big meetings. We do in short propaganda work". But at the
Presidential election the JSS members were unable to engage in such
activities.

The evidence further shows that about 10 office-bearers in party branches and
about 15 other supporters were killed from about

35

mid-September 1988 in the Matale electoral district. On 18.11.88 K. G. Loku
Banda a staunch party supporter in the Matale polling division was, killed.
The treasurer of the Kotuwegedera branch was killed on 22.11.88 and a member
of the same branch was shot at in the course of the same incident. A prominent
UNP worker M. J. Shahabdeen from Madipola was killed on 17.12.88. On the same
day A. L. M. Sarada, chief organizer of Undugoda Palle Siyapattuwa was
attacked.

There was evidence of a somewhat unusual incident that took place on 17.12.88
in the Laggala polling division. Biso Menika, a strong UNP supporter was
threatened, her hair was cut and was ordered to carry a poster and cycle a
distance of 15 miles up to Hettipola and back to her village, passing through
7 villages. She produced the posters (1 R 81 and 1 R 82) and also produced the
cut hair in court. The poster reads, "This is the punishment for finding fault
with the patriotic comrades". By the 15th of December most of the UNP chief
organizers of the Laggala polling division had resigned owing to death
threats.

It is unnecessary to enumerate the other incidents relating to the killings
of, and attacks on office-bearers and party supporters. There is little doubt
that the intimidation directed against the supporters of the 1st respondent
was by no means insignificant.

**Electoral District No. 06 - Nuwara Eliya**

**Paragraph (vi) (a)** reads thus:- "A large number of voters of Thibbotugoda
polling station (No. 21). Rupaha polling station (No.44) in the Walapone
polling division were forcibly prevented from voting for the candidate of
their choice by gangs of unknown persons who had blocked the access roads to
the polling stations". There is the evidence of T B. Wickremasinghe that a
water channel had been diverted across the access road to Thibbotugoda polling
station. There were 552 registered voters but only 2 votes had been cast. As
regards Rupaha polling station there is no satisfactory evidence to establish
that the access road was blocked.

**Paragraph (vi) (b)** Although the allegation here is that the houses of SLFP
supporters were burnt in Beramana village on 04.12.88, the-

36

evidence of the Police officer establishes that only one house of an - SLFP
supporter was burnt on 07.12.88. This is not challenged.

There are 272 polling stations in the electoral district but the petition
refers to incidents in only 2 polling stations. There is no complaint in
respect of threatening posters. The voter turn-out at the Presidential
election was as high as 79.96%.

**Electoral District No. 07- Galle**

**Paragraph (ivA) (a)** states that for 2 weeks prior to 19.12.88 unknown
persons threatened A. M. Karunaratne, SLFP organizer for Ambalangoda and his
wife at their house. This is clearly proved by the evidence of Karunaratne and
his wife. In fact the incident is admitted.

**Paragraph (ivA) (b)** alleges that the house of Saman de Silva co-organizer
for Ambalangoda was burnt. This incident too is not challenged.

There is evidence of threatening posters in the polling divisions of
Ambalangoda, Balapitiya, Bentota-Elpitiya, Karandeniya and Ratgama.

On the other hand the evidence led on behalf of the 1st respondent shows that
about 40 office-bearers of party branches were killed from mid-September 1988.
B. G. Bandusena, Secretary, Doralla branch, Osmund Jayasooriya, Secretary
Youth League, Mahawatte, S. Wimalasooriya, Treasurer, Patabendimulla branch,
G. K. Y. Lokuge, Secretary Illukpitiya branch, P. V.. Piyadasa, President JSS
branch at the Plywood Corporation; Gintota, were all killed in the months of
October, November and December 1988. In many instances a poster was found by
the body of the deceased stating that the reason for the killing was working
for the UNP In the Balapitiya polling division 5 strong UNP supporters were
tied together and killed on 19.11.88. M. M. Nandasena, Secretary UNP branch
Nugaduwa in the Akmeemana polling division was killed on 09.11.88. In the
Ambalangoda polling division alone 16 office-bearers and supporters were
killed between 23.10.88 and 12.12.88. Consequent

37

upon these killings several local organizers and office-bearers resigned from
their posts by displaying banners and putting up posters. The election
campaign and the organisation suffered a serious setback. In addition there is
evidence of posters specifically directed against the UNP and its supporters
in the Ambalangoda, Bentara-Elpitiya, Habaraduwa, Galle, Baddegama,
Karandeniya, Balapitiya and Hiniduma polling divisions.

**Electoral District No. 08 - Matara**

**Paragraph (vii) (a)** The petitioner relies on one incident, viz. a large
number of voters of Buddha Jayanthi polling station (No. 08) of Hakmana
polling division were prevented from voting for the candidate of their choice
by gangs of unknown persons who had blocked the access roads to the polling
station. The petitioner called 2 witnesses (Amaradasa and Sethupala) but their
evidence is completely contrary to the allegation in the petition. According
to the evidence of the Senior Presiding Officer Amaradasa, he reached the
polling station and the road had been cleared. We acordingly hold that the
allegation has not been proved.

The petitioner led evidence of intimidatory posters in the polling divisions
of Hakmana, Akuressa, Deniyaya, Weligama, Devinuwara and Kamburupitiya: There
is one witness, Sumanawathie Pahalage, of Akuressa called by the petitioner to
give evidence on posters who admitted in re-examination that the killings
affected mostly the UNP and its supporters.

The Matara electoral district consists of 7 polling divisions and there are
358 polling stations. The 1st respondent has led evidence of killings and
attacks on his supporters in the polling divisions of Kamburupitiya, Akuressa,
Deniyaya, Weligama, Devinuwara and Hakmana. The evidence shows that 53 office-
bearers of UNP branches and other supporters were killed between September and
December 1988\. H. H. Sirisena, President of Ududamana party branch in the
Kamburupitiya polling division was shot and killed on 27.09.88 and his head
was severed from the body. K. Siyaneris, organizer for the UNP at Diganahena
in Akuressa polling division was shot and killed on 15.10.88. M. L. Diyonis,
the organizer for

38

Pahala Maliyaduwa was shot dead on 18.09.88. R. Vettasinghe, Secretary of the
Malimbada Youth League was shot dead on 07.12.88. A poster put up after his
death stated that he was killed by the JVP because he supported the UNP. On
12.12.88 K. G. W. Rajapaksa, Superintendent of WiIpita State Plantation and a
staunch UNP supporter was killed in his office. A. R. Siriwardena, an active
UNP worker and a member of the JSS who worked during the Presidential election
campaign was stabbed to death on 17.12.88. After his death, posters appeared
stating that he was killed because he was a staunch UNP supporter. On the same
day another active UNP worker was killed and posters appeared later giving the
reason for the killing - that he was a supporter of the UNP. Francis Weeraman,
another strong UNP supporter was shot and killed on 18.12.88. After his death
posters appeared stating "death is the punishment for traitors who worked for
the UNP". It is in evidence that almost all the office-bearers of the JSS
branch of Matara C.T.B. depot resigned in October 1988 consequent upon
receiving threatening letters. On 09.12.88 R. P. Gamini, Secretary of the
Urubokka Bala Mandalaya and an undergraduate of the University of Ruhuna was
killed.

V.P.Abeywickrema, a member of the Provincial Council for the Southern Province
stated in his evidence that the numerous threats and killings of UNP
supporters seriously affected the election campaign and organisational work of
the UNP. He further said "ail this affected the voting of the UNP supporters
at the election". D. A. Wickremasinghe, M.P. for the Matara District also
testified to the effect the attacks and the killings had on the election
campaign:

Q. At the time of this Presidential election campaign of 1988 what was the
state of the UNP organizations at village level?

A. Our organization had got paralysed at village level because some office-
bearers had been killed and some had left the village.

Q. As a result what was the effect of this on the Presidential election
campaign of 1988 of the UNP?

A. Our organisational capacity became very much weakened.

Q. Were you able to hold meetings at village level?

A. No ...

39

Q. Were you able to go house to house canvassing?

A. No.

Q. The normal election work could not be done?

A. That is so.

Q. Were you able to get polling agents?

A. No, we were unable to get.

**Electoral District No. 09 - Hambantota**

**Paragraph (viii) (a)** reads thus:- "SLFP organizer (R. Dharmasena) who was
in charge of 27 polling stations in the Mulkirigala polling division was shot
dead by unknown persons on 15.12.88". This incident has not been challenged.
The widow Kusumawathie spoke to the circumstances in which her husband came by
his death.

**Paragraph (viii) (b)** The incident pleaded here is that another SLFP
organizer, Dissanayake, who was in charge of 15 polling stations in the
Mulkirigala polling division was killed by unknown persons before the
elections. This killing too is admitted. It would appear that he was killed on
the night of 14th December 1988.

The killing of the SLFP organizers in the Mulkirigala polling division would
undoubtedly have had a grave impact on the supporters of the SLFP. The
petitioner has also led evidence of intimidatory posters in all the 4 polling
divisions in the Hambantota electoral district.

The 1st respondent led evidence of threats, attacks, and a few killings of
office-bearers and party supporters during the Presidential election campaign.
Harry Abeydeera, M.P. for the Hambantota district testified to the effect of
those incidents:

Q. And for the Presidential election in 1988 could your party organization in
Beliatte electorate function at all?

A. No.

Q. Was your UNP organization in the Tissa electorate also able to function for
this Presidential election in 1988?

A. No.

Q. In Mulkirigala?

A. No.

Q. And in Tangalla too was the position the same?

A. Yes.

40

He also referred to the meetings held in support of the 1st respondent at
Katuwana on 12.11.88, at Beliatte on 20.11.88 and at Tangalla on 27.11.88, all
of which proved to be a failure owing to bomb explosions and shots being fired
in the vicinity of the venue of the meetings. At the meeting at Tangalla
posters appeared warning people not to attend the meeting. UNP polling agents
too were afraid to function at the polling stations in the Hambantota
electoral district.

Chamal Rajapakse, M.P. for the Hambantota district called by the petitioner
admitted that persons from families who were known to be supporters of the UNP
were killed in Walasmulle and Middeniya. This was between 10th November and
19th December 1988. When asked whether the UNP "suffered from the killings of
its party supporters and workers", his answer was "that started with the
signing of the Accord".

**Electoral District No. 15 - Kurunegala**

The Kurunegala electoral district has 14 polling divisions and 638 polling
stations. At the 1988 Presidential election the voter turn-out for the
Kurunegala electoral district was 50.05%. Apart from the incidents set out in
the petition, intimidatory posters have been pleaded in 4 polling divisions.

**Paragraph (xi) (a)** The averment here is that the access roads to the
Kudagalgamuwa polling station (No. 10) were blocked and voters were harassed
by gangs of unknown persons.

The petitioner called 5 witnesses. Two of these witnesses (R. M. Tilakaratne
and R. M. Punchi Banda) remained at Minhettiya which is about 3 miles away
from Kudagalgamuwa and could not have known whether the access roads were
blocked or not. Witness S. B. M. Ranasinghe had walked from Edandawela to
Kudagalgamuwa and denies the existence of road blocks. The only witness who
speaks to road blocks is T M. Ranbanda. It is thus seen that the evidence is
of a contradictory nature. We accordingly hold that the allegation has not
been proved.

**Paragraph (xi) (b)** The petitioner led no evidence in regard to the alleged
attack on polling station Mahakeliya (No. 06) in Wariyapola polling division.

41

**Paragraph (xi) (c)** Polling station Hewanpellessa (No. 25) in the
Nikaweratiya polling division was attacked on 19.12.88. This incident has not
been challenged.

**Paragraph (xi) (d)** The allegation is that persons who came to vote at
polling station Yayawatte (No. 25) and Galpola (No. 30) were shot at and two
voters were killed. The evidence establishes that one voter named Najibudeen
was killed at polling station Yayawatte (No. 25). No evidence was led in
regard to any incident at polling station Galpola (No. 30).

**Paragraph (xi) (e)** It is averred that persons who came to vote at polling
station lhala Gomugonuwa (No. 29) were shot at on 19.12.88 and one person
died. This incident is admitted and the person who died is Tikiri Banda, a
supporter of the SLFP. The incident occurred during polling hours.

**Paragraph (xi) (f)** On 18.12.88 two SLFP supporters of Nikeweratiya were
killed by unknown persons. This incident was not challenged.

**Paragraph (xi) (g)** On 18.12.88 the house of A. Tennekoon, the SLFP
organizer for Nikaweratiya was attacked in the night by unknown persons who
threatened him and his family. This incident too was not disputed.

**Paragraph (xi) (h)** "Four members of the SLFP in the Galgamuwa polling
division were brutally killed just prior to the elections". Two witnesses, S.
H. Podiratne and Bandula Basnayake were called to speak to this incident. The
evidence clearly proves that 4 persons were killed and 3 of them were SLFP
supporters.

**Paragraph (xi) (i)** "A large number of voters in Galgamuwa polling division
were threatened by gangs of persons by shooting and other forms of
intimidation". There was only one witness, Bandula Basanayake SLFP organizer
for Galgamuwa called to testify to this incident. He spoke of a gang of
persons attacking his vehicle when passing through a jungle area on his way to
a polling station on polling day. There is no evidence to prove the allegation
as pleaded

42

in the petition. We accordingly hold that the incident has not been
established.

**Paragraph (xi) (j)** "A large number of voters in the Hamangalla area in the
Katugampola polling division were threatened by gangs of unknown persons
coming to their homes and threatening them not to vote, firing shots in the
air in the night as well as putting up posters threatening them not to vote".
The petitioner called 3 witnesses who asserted that gangs of persons visited
their homes and threatened them not to vote. Two of these witnesses however
did function as polling agents. We hold that the evidence establishes that
voters were threatened between the 15th and 17th of December 1988 not to
exercise their vote.

On a consideration of the evidence led on behalf of the petitioner we hold
that there was a fair degree of intimidation directed at the SLFP supporters
in the Kurunegala electoral district.

As against this, Mr. Choksy for the 1st respondent led a substantial volume of
evidence of killings and attacks on organizers, office bearers and supporters
of the UNP The evidence reveals that there were 62 killings of UNP office-
bearers and supporters in the months of September, October, November and
December 1988. (up to 19.12.88) in the Kurunegala electoral district. These
incidents were of a widespread nature covering 10 out of the 14 polling
divisions of the Kurunegala electoral district. Lionel Jayatilaka, a Cabinet
Minister, was killed on 26.9.88 and his death frightened office-bearers and
members of party branches in Kuliyapitiya. J. S. Jane Nona, Chief organizer,
UNP Women's League in Kuliyapitiya was shot at on 02.11.88 and thereafter she
left the village. J. A. Nilangaratne, the treasurer of the local party branch
and an active worker was killed on 05.12.88. A. W. M. Thaha, President of the
local party branch and the leader of the Muslims in the village of Arakyala
was killed on 18.12.88. D. M. Abeyratne Banda, the organizer of the
Medagamdahaya Korale Bala Mandalaya was shot and killed on 08.12.88. This
resulted in office-bearers giving up party work through fear. Three UNP
supporters in the Dambadeniya polling division were killed in the same
incident on 11.12.88 and the killers had left a poster which stated that they
were killed because they worked for the

43

UNP in their village. In the Dambadeniya polling division several office-
bearers who had resigned from their posts in their party branches had
displayed banners announcing their resignation. The brother of M. H. B.
Wanninayake, M.P. was killed on 12.11.88 in the Nikeweratiya polling division.
H. M. A. Loku Banda, M.P. for the Kurunegala district stated that he saw
posters in the Galgamuwa polling division saying that the UNP supporters are
prohibited from voting. J. Balasuriya, President of the Koswatte party branch
in the Panduwasnuwara polling division was killed on 25.11.88. There is
evidence to show that there were posters specifically directed at the UNP in
the polling divisions of Kuliyapitiya, Wariyapola, Nikaweratiya, Katugampola,
Panduwasnuwara, Yapahuwa and Dodangaslanda.

**Electoral District No. 16 - Puttalam**

The petitioner has pleaded 4 incidents but no evidence was led in regard to
two incidents, namely, paragraph (xii) (c) and (d). Evidence was led in
respect of paragraphs (a) and (b).

**Paragraph (xii) (a)** "In the Anamaduwa polling division a Ven. Buddhist
monk who is an SLFP supporter was dragged out of his temple in Wadigamangawa
and mercilessly assaulted". Witness Karunaratne speaks to the assault on the
priest but he says the assault appears to have been on account of his personal
conduct and not due to any political activity. We hold that the incident as
pleaded has not been proved.

**Paragraph (xii) (b)** :- "Shooting at and intimidation of voters took place
at the polling station No.13 (Thalgaswewa) by unknown persons". Wimalasuriya
was the witness called to speak to this incident. He said that he heard
gunshots around the polling station. No officer who functioned at the polling
station was called by the petitioner. There is no record of the alleged
shooting in the journal. The 1st respondent called a police officer who was on
duty at the polling station and he denied that such an incident took place.
The evidence is unsatisfactory and we hold that the alleged incident has not
been established.

On the other hand, the 1st respondent led evidence of the killing of 3 office-
bearers of party branches in the Puttalam electoral district, in

44

the month of December 1988. Keerthi Sovis, President of the UNP Youth League,
Mahuswewa, was shot dead on 16.12.88. There was a poster beside his body which
stated: "This is the punishment for treacherous UNP supporters". Sunil Ananda,
Secretary of the local party branch was shot and killed on 17.12.88. A poster
was put up stating "Sunil Ananda was killed because he was a stooge of the
UNP"; I. B. Fernando, President of the UNP Youth League at Wennappuwa and
President of the party branch at Waikkal was killed on 02.12.88.

**Electoral District No. 17- Anuradhapura**

**Paragraph (xiii) (a)** "On 19.12.88 two voters H. F Mohammed and Carim of
Mookiriyawa in the Horawapathana polling division were shot dead by unknown
persons". Three witnesses namely, Shahabdeen, Piyadasa and Inspector of Police
Ratnayake were called to testify to this incident. The incident is admitted.
However, the 1st respondent called a witness named N. Cader who claimed that
the two deceased persons were UNP polling agents, killed on their way to the
polling station. This belated claim is not acceptable as it was never put to
the witnesses called by the petitioner.

**Paragraph (xiii) (b)** 'On 19.12.88 election staff travelling to the polling
station at Parangiya Wadiya Ranpathwila in a vehicle were shot at by unknown
persons and one Piyadasa was injured in the Horawapathana polling division".
The incident is not disputed. Mr. Choksy pointed out that there is no
complaint that the polling station did not function on account of this attack.

**Paragraph (xiii) (c)** "On 19.12.88 election staff travelling in vehicle No.
29 Sri 247 was shot at by unknown persons". The incident is admitted. There is
evidence to show that the poll was in fact conducted at the polling station.
No one was injured.

**Paragraph (xill) (d)** "On 19.12.88 police mobile patrol of S. I. Wijekoon
was shot at and attacked. S. I. Wijekoon, the driver and a Home Guard were
injured and one Army Private died. This happened in the Medawachchiya polling
division". This incident is admitted. It occurred when the vehicle was
proceeding in a jungle area.

45

**Paragraph (xiii) (e)** "In Kalawewa polling division in the polling station
area No. 24 (Katiyaya Yaya) 5 SLFP supporters were killed about 15 days prior
to the election day by unknown persons. Twelve days prior to the election day
another SLFP supporter was killed and on the day before the election another
supporter of the SLFP was killed by unknown persons". The killings are
admitted. The allegation that those killed were SLFP supporters is disputed.
The evidence of Muthukumarena is sufficient to prove that the 5 persons killed
about 15 days prior to the election were SLFP supporters. However, the
identity of the other 2 persons killed has not been established.

**Paragraph (xiii) (f)** "In the polling division of Mihintale unknown persons
armed with guns prevented voters from voting at polling station Manewa (No.
22)". The evidence led on behalf of the petitioner does not prove the incident
as pleaded. The chief witness was M. Ariyadasa. All that the evidence
establishes is that Ariyadasa alone was prevented from proceeding to the
polling station by an armed gang of persons who assaulted him. Ariyadasa was
an SLFP polling agent.

**Paragraph (xiii) (g)** "On 19.12.88 polling station No.26 (Kongahawewa) was
attacked by unknown persons". No evidence was led to prove this allegation.

The petitioner also led evidence of threatening posters in the polling
divisions of Horawapathana, Kekirawa and Mihintale.

The 1st respondent called evidence to establish killings of, and attacks on,
organizers, office-bearers and supporters of the UNP in all 7 polling
divisions of the Anuradhapura electoral district. The evidence shows that
about 39 office-bearers and supporters of the UNP were killed during the
period September to December 1988. In the Anuradhapura district there were 7
C.T.B. depots and each had its own JSS branch. On account of threats by the
JVP almost all the office-bearers in the JSS resigned. As ordered by the JVP
they put up banners stating that they have resigned from the UNP and the JSS.
Witness A. Jayatilake, a UNP supporter in Kekirawa polling division said that
on 15.12.88 he saw posters put up opposite his house stating "UNP voters will
be killed". A. B. Ariyadasa, President of the

46

UNP Bala Mandalaya, Kalawewa, was killed on 24.11.88. There was a writing near
his body which stated that he was killed for working for the UNP T M.
Abeyratne, an active UNP supporter who addresed several meetings in
Anuradhapura East and the adjoining electorates was shot at and injured on
21.11.88. Earlier he had received threatening letters from the JVP. D.
Kithsiri, President of the UNP branch, Turuwila, was shot dead in his house on
03.12.88. His family were supporters of the UNP but after his death they
refrained from political work. M. B. Basnayake, President of the UNP branch
Ottappuwa was killed on 07.12.88. A poster was found near his body stating
that death is the punishment for working for the UNP. The evidence also shows
that a very large number of office-bearers in the UNP branches resigned and
kept away from political work owing to threats from the JVP.

**Electoral District No.18 \- Polonnaruwa**

**Paragraph (xiv) (a)** "In the polling division of Medirigiriya at polling
booth No. 09, Thelawewa, unknown persons opened fire and injured 5 persons on
19.12.88". This incident is admitted but the number of persons injured is 3
and not 5, as is seen from the evidence of the police officers called by the
petitioner. Moreover, the 1st respondent called B.K. Guneratne who asserted
that the 3 injured persons were UNP supporters. No evidence to the contrary
was led by the petitioner.

**Paragraph (xiv) (b)** "In the polling division of Polonnaruwa a person by
the name of J.M. Jayawardena was shot dead by unknown persons on 19.12.88".
This incident is not disputed. However, the evidence of Police Inspector
Gunasekera called by the petitioner and the evidence of B.K. Gunaratne called
by the 1st respondent show that the deceased was a UNP supporter.

**Paragraph (xiv) (c)** "in the polling division of Polonnaruwa a person by
the name of Ariyasena was shot dead on 19.12.88." The incident is admitted.
The victim was a supporter of the UNP according to the evidence of Police
Inspector de Silva called by the petitioner and also the evidence of B. K.
Guneratne called by the 1st respondent.

47

It would thus appear that on the evidence all 5 victims in the Polonnaruwa
electoral district were supporters of the UNP. Even in the pleadings the
petitioner did not claim that they were supporters of the SLFP.

As against this, the evidence led on behalf of the 1st respondent reveals that
13 UNP office-bearers and supporters were killed between September and
December 1988. W. C. Boyagoda, Secretary UNP branch at Hathamune was shot dead
on 23.09.88. Quintus Fernando, President of the UNP branch of Henyaya and
member of the Bala Mandalaya was shot and killed in his house on 05.12.88. S.
A. Maithripala, Secretary of the UNP branch at Yatigalpatana was killed on
17.12.88.

**Electoral District No.19 \- Badulla**

**Paragraph (xv) (a)** "in the polling division of Welimada at Weegolla a
Senior Presiding Officer was shot dead and a civilian and a police constable
were injured on 19.12.88". The incident is admitted. It took place at about
5.10 p.m. after the close of the poll when the vehicle was returning to the
Badulla Kachcheri. The ballot boxes were not damaged and were taken to the
Badulla Kachcheri for the count. This incident which took place after the poll
had no adverse effect on voters.

**Paragraph (xv) (b)** "In the polling division of Welimada booth No. 30
(Alugolla) and No. 40 (Ohiya) were attacked by unknown persons". The attack on
booth No. 30 (Alugolla) is admitted, but there is no evidence of an attack on
booth No. 40 (Ohiya). The attack took place at 12.45 p.m. and at that time
there were only 3 voters in the queue and they had run away.

**Paragraph (xv) (c)** "In the polling division of Bandarawela police found 8
persons murdered at Ellethota near the railway bridge on 19.12.88". This
incident is not challenged. It was elicited in cross examination from Police
Inspector Jayatissa that all the deceased persons were supporters of the UNP.
However, the incident occurred well after the close of the poll and it could
not have had any adverse effect on voters.

48

**Paragraph (xv) (d)** "Between 3rd and 5th December 1988 in the polling
division of Viyaluwa unknown persons in police uniform at Meegahakivula
threatened SLFP supporters not to vote on 19.12.88". This incident is not
challenged. The evidence indicates that there were houses of UNP supporters
also in this village.

**Paragraph (xv) (e)** In the Bandarawela polling division a bomb was thrown
at W. Ratnayake, Chief organizer's (SLFP) residence No. 20, Badulla Road,
Bandarawela on 18.12.88". This incident is not challenged.

**Paragraph (xv) (f)** "The SLFP chief organizer for Passara polling division,
D. G. M. Landawela was shot dead on 17.12.88 by unknown persons". This
incident is admitted. It would have definitely affected the SLFP supporters
adversely in the Passara polling division.

The evidence led on behalf of the 1st respondent shows that during the period
September to December 1988 as many as 18 office-bearers of the party branches
were killed in the Badulla electoral district. W. M. Amerasekera, President of
the UNP branch at Boralanda and a member of the UNP Youth League was killed on
26.09.88. In the same incident a supporter of the UNP called R. M. Jayasena
was also killed. R. M. Razak, the UNP organizer for Welimada and Uva
Paranagama received a number of threatening letters. He thereafter stopped
working for the UNP and left his village ten days prior to 19.12.88. L. M.
Muthu Banda, President of the Rilpola Korale UNP branch who had earlier
received threatening letters was shot dead on 27.11.88. David Appuhamy,
Secretary Bogoda North Bala Mandalaya was killed on 11.12.88. R. M. B.
Ratnayake, President of the UNP Youth League, Katugaha branch and President of
Deluwina Korale Balamandalaya resigned from the offices he held in November
1988 by publishing a notice and distributing it in the village - vide 1R 67.
A. J. M. Upasena, President of the Dowa UNP branch and JSS member,
Bandarawela, stated that in October and November 1988 three active JSS members
were killed. It is in evidence that the JSS worked actively for the UNP at
every previous election.

49

**Electoral District No. 20 - Moneragala**

**Paragraph (xvi) (a)** "On 18th December 1988 (unknown persons in uniform)
removed SLFP posters and the SLFP office board in Moneragala". This incident
is not admitted by Mr. Choksy. The petitioner called H. M. Wijeratne to speak
to the incident. He was present on the occasion the board was removed. He
admitted that he made no complaint to the police and the reason was that he
was afraid to do so. We accept his evidence and we hold that the incident has
been proved.

**Paragraph (xvi) (b)** "Trees were cut down and the road obstructed from
Badalkumbura to Passara. Four culverts were damaged and the road from
Hingurukaduwa to Badalkumbura was made impassable on 19.12.88". Two witnesses
were called by the petitioner, namely, Sugathadasa and Wijekoon. Admittedly
Sugathadasa did not go out of his house on 17th, 18th and 19th December and he
could not have known anything about the state of the road. Wijekoon claimed
that he saw the obstructions on the road but he further stated that he had a
suspicion that the posters appearing at the time of the Presidential election
were put up by the UNP and that the UNP may have killed their own supporters.
His evidence when considered as a whole is unacceptable. We hold that the
allegation is not proved.

**Paragraph (xvi) (c)** "in the Wellawaya polling division when Senior
Presiding Officer S. Abeysundera and his, staff were proceeding to the polling
station (No. 22) Tanamalwila his vehicle was stopped at Baddandiyaya and fired
at, Two police officers sustained injuries". The incident is admitted. It
occurred on 18th December 1988 at about 8 p.m. There is no evidence that the
polling station did not function on 19.12.88.

**Paragraph (xvi) (d)** "In the polling division of Wellawaya mobile police.
patrol was attacked on 19.12.88 by unknown persons and 3 police constables
were injured". No evidence was led in support of this allegation.

**Paragraph (xvi) (e)** "In the Moneragala polling division 2 Army soldiers
were shot at and injured by unknown persons on 19.12.88".

50

The incident is admitted. The evidence shows that the election staff travelled
in another vehicle and they proceeded to the polling station. The conduct of
the poll was not affected by this incident.

**Paragraph (xvi) (f)** "in the Moneragala polling division, S. I. Silva and
party while on mobile patrol were attacked by unknown persons on 19.12.88 and
3 police constables and the driver were injured". The incident is admitted.
However, it had no adverse effect on the conduct of the poll because the
incident took place on the return journey after the ballot boxes had been
taken to the polling station.

**Paragraph (xvi) (g)** "In the Wellawaya polling division at Buttala, police
mobile patrol party was attacked by unknown persons and police sergeant 5060
and a reserve police constable were injured on 19.12.88". This incident is
admitted. The evidence establishes that the Senior Presiding Officer and the
election staff refused to proceed any further. Neither the ballot box nor the
election staff reached the polling station.

**Paragraph (xvi) (h)** "In the Moneragala polling division

(i) Notices were put up at Moneragala warning people not to vote.

(ii) an unofficial curfew was enforced from 17th December 1988.

(iii) bombs were exploded and guns were fired in the Moneragala town on
19.12.88 morning".

The averments in (i) and (ii) are admitted. As regards (iii) the evidence does
not show that the explosion of the bombs and the firing took place in the
Moneragala town.

**Paragraph (xvi) (i)** "In the Wellawaya polling division, the SLFP
divisional agent was forcibly prevented from entering the polling station at
Weliyara". The incident is admitted. There is no evidence to show that this
incident adversely affected voters or the conduct of the poll.

**Paragraph (xvi) (j)** "In the Wellawaya polling division on 19.12.88 at
about 1.30 p.m. RC. 24217 Abeyratne Banda was on duty at

51

 the polling booth at Yudagamsuwa Junior School, when about 25 armed unknown
persons in uniform had entered the polling booth and had robbed the guns of
PC. 24217 and R. P C. Premeratne having tied the police officers and dashed
the ballot box on the floor". The incident is admitted. It is referred to in
the petition in respect of the charge of non-compliance".

The evidence adduced by the 1st respondent shows that as many as 35 office-
bearers and supporters of the UNP were killed during the months of September,
October, November and December 1988, in the Moneragala electoral district. It
is in evidence that families of well known UNP supporters were done to death.
D. M. Piyadasa, President of the UNP branch at Weliyaya was killed on
29.10.88. A poster was found near his body stating "death for those who stooge
for the UNP". M. M. Loku Bandara, President of the Hulandawa UNP branch was
killed on 31.10.88. A poster lying by his body stated "death for those who
stooge for the UNP. H. M. Sirisena of the Wellawaya polling division who had
served as a UNP polling agent since 1965 was killed on 14.10.88. At the scene
of the killing a poster appeared stating "punishment is death for those who
support the treacherous UNP". K. D. Keerthiratne, Committee Member of the UNP
Youth League at Badalkumbura was shot and killed on 01.12.88. He had earlier
received threatening letters asking him to stop working for the UNP, but he
had not complied with those orders. A poster appeared later saying that he was
punished for working for the UNP

**Electoral District No. 22 - Kegalle**

**Paragraph (xvii) (a)** "In the polling division of Yatiyantota SLFP branch
office at Ambanwela was set on fire on 18.12.88". The witness who testified to
this incident is Kodikara, the SLFP organizer for Yatiyantota. He stated that
he made a complaint to the police but at the inquiry before the A.S.P. he
withdrew the complaint. We are of the view that the evidence on record is not
sufficient to prove the incident.

**Paragraph (xvii) (b)** "In the polling division of Rambukkana unknown
persons threatened voters and set up explosives around the polling booth at
Parape (No. 26) on 19.12.88". It is admitted that sounds of explosions were
heard around the polling station, but there

52

is no acceptable evidence to prove the allegation that voters were threatened.

**Paragraph (xvii) (c)** "in the polling divisions of Yatiyantota -
Deraniyagala on 18.12.88 the SLFP branch offices at Teligama and Kitulgala
were destroyed. In Yatiyantota polling booth at Siriwardena Balika Vidyalaya
(No. 01) SLFP polling agents were not allowed to attend to their duties". It
is admitted that the SLFP branch office at Teligama was destroyed. The
evidence of witness Kodikara is sufficient to prove the attack on the SLFP
branch office at Kitulgala. There is no satisfactory evidence to prove the
allegation that the SLFP polling agents were not allowed to attend to their
duties at the Siriwardena Balika Vidyalaya (No. 01).

**Paragraph (xvii) (d)** It is alleged that in the polling division of
Aranayaka, (i) on 05.12.88 the SLFP electoral office at 369, Dippitiya Bazaar
at Aranayake was set on fire, (ii) on 08.12.88 the stage constructed for the
SLFP mass meeting was set on fire and M. Dayananda of Podapa who was guarding
the stage was shot and killed, (iii) the polling station at Wakirigala Raja
Maha Viharaya (No.04) was damaged by bombs being thrown at it on 19.12.88
before polling started. All three incidents set out above are admitted.

The evidence discloses that there was a fair amount of intimidation directed
against the SLFP in the Kegalla electoral district. No evidence was adduced by
the 1st respondent in respect of the Kegalle electoral district.

We have outlined above the facts and circumstances relied upon by the
petitioner and the 1st respondent in relation to the charge of general
intimidation which is the charge that was pressed before us by Mr. de Silva in
his closing address. However, it is right to state here that neither Mr. de
Silva nor Mr. R. K. W Gunesekera made any submissions on the several acts or
instances of violence and threats which the 1st respondent claimed were
directed at his party and his supporters. Indeed the cross-examination of the
witnesses called on behalf of the 1st respondent shows that by and large the
incidents as such were not denied. What was suggested was that those incidents
had no connection whatever with the Presidential election; the

53

killings, attacks and threats were not politically motivated. The suggestions
however were flatly denied by the witnesses themselves. They remained as mere
suggestions wholly unsupported by evidence.

On a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence placed before us
relating to the charge of general intimidation, it appears to us that the
thrust of the JVP violence was directed against the UNP. Between the period
17.09.88 and 19.12.88 (16.09.88 being the date on which the Working Committee
of the UNP chose the 1st respondent as the candidate, according to the
evidence on record) as many as 413 organizers, office-bearers and supporters
of the UNP were killed, and 237 were attacked. For the same period 32 SLFP
organizers, office-bearers were killed and 23 of them were attacked. The acts
of violence against the UNP were spread throughout 80 polling divisions in 15
electoral districts, whereas the anti-SLFP incidents occurred in 23 polling
divisions in 13 electoral districts. Further the incidents against the UNP
were spread over a longer period of time, having regard to the evidence on
record. The evidence reveals that the numerous threats, killings and attacks
on local party organizers and office-bearers of the UNP branches at the
village level resulted in a serious and irreparable setback to the
organisation and the campaign of the 1st respondent. In addition there was
considerable evidence of resignations from. UNP branches by office-bearers and
even ordinary members.

These resignations were consequent upon threats conveyed by letters. Several
of these threatening letters were marked in evidence, letters which called
upon the people not to work for and support the UNP - vide 1R 41. The document
1R 42 refers to the UNP as a "banned party", "orders" office-bearers and
members to resign from "this traitorous organisation". and upon failure to do
so "sentence of death would be carried out". 1 R 43 is another significant
document which bears the heading "Banning of the United National Party". It
reads thus:- "The United National Party which has been traitorous to the
motherland is banned with immediate effect. All members are required to resign
from membership and from all the offices they hold. All persons should cease
to lend any kind of support to the

54

banned UNP. Death for those who violate the above conditions - Joint
Commanding Headquarters of the Patriotic Peoples' Armed Troops". These
documents single out the UNP as the target of attack. Besides, there were
threats directed at office-bearers and members of the JSS and large numbers
were compelled to resign. It is in evidence that the JSS actively supported
the UNP at previous elections. Many of those who were ordered to resign from
the party or the JSS were also directed to put up "banners" and notices in
public places announcing their resignations - vide 1R5, 1R109, 1R129, 1R 138,
1R 147,1R 148,1R 150,1R 151,1R 155,1R 160,1R 162,1R 163,1R 164 and 1R167. It
is natural that all this would have had a strong adverse effect on supporters
of the 1st respondent at the Presidential elections. We are satisfied that the
oral and documentary evidence on record establishes that the weight of the JVP
intimidation and violence was directed at the UNP and its supporters and this
has contributed in no small measure to the low voter turn-out on 19.12.88.

There is another relevant matter to which we must refer. Mr. Choksy drew our
attention to paragraph 05 of the petition wherein it is averred that according
to the results declared by the Commissioner of Elections, the majority by
which the 1st respondent won is 279339 Notes. It was the submission of Counsel
that even if the petitioner got one more vote than the majority obtained by
the 1st respondent she could still not have been declared elected. Mr. Choksy
contended that the petitioner in order to win had to get the total votes
received jointly by the UNP and the SLMP plus one more vote. Thus she would
have had to get 515059 more votes than she polled in order to have succeeded
at the election. It appears to us that this submission is well-founded.

The question then is, upon a review of all the evidence, whether the acts or
instances of intimidation had the requisite effect, namely, that the "majority
of electors were or many have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred". In the preliminary order this Court has already ruled on the
"true meaning" of these words in s.91 (a). The burden of proof is clearly on
the petitioner in terms of s.91 (a). However slight that burden may be,
(having regard to the

55

use of the words "were or may have been prevented") yet the burden of proof
remains on the petitioner. We do not agree with Mr. de Silva's contention that
the word "may" also envisages the existence of "may not" and is not
inconsistent with it. The petitioner cannot leave this important ingredient of
the charge in doubt and yet claim that the burden has been discharged.
Considering all the evidence in the case, we hold that the petitioner has not
succeeded in establishing that the "result of the election may have been
affected (1989 1 Sri L.R. 240 at 270)(1). Accordingly, the charge of "general
intimidation" relied on by the petitioner as a ground of avoidance of the
election fails.

We wish to make it clear that in arriving at the above conclusion we have not
taken into consideration the results of the Parliamentary election held in
February 1989, although this was an item of evidence very strongly relied on
by Mr. Choksy. It was the contention of Mr. Choksy (i) that the evidence shows
that there was less violence at the Parliamentary election in February 1989
than at the Presidential election of 1988, (ii) consequently there was a
larger voter turn-out at the Parliamentary election, (iii) a comparison of the
results of the December 1988 Presidential election and the Parliamentary
election of February 1989 shows that the bulk of the "extra votes" cast in
February 1989 were in favour of the UNP; this proves that it was the UNP that
stood to gain when there was a decline in the violence. However, as pointed
out by Mr. R. K. W. Gunasekera, the evidence to establish that there was less
violence in February 1989 is of a tenuous nature. At the Parliamentary
election there were a fair number of parties and a large number of candidates.
Some of the parties and "independent groups" did not "field" candidates on an
islandwide basis. And more importantly, this was an election held
**subsequent** to the Presidential election where the 1st respondent had
already been declared elected. Having regard to all the circumstances, we
agree with the submission of Mr. Gunasekera that it is quite unsafe to draw
any conclusions from the results of the Parliamentary election of February
1989, notwithstanding its proximity in time to the Presidential election.

56

**The charge relating to "other circumstances" as a ground of avoidance of the
election under Section 91 (a) of the Act: **

We now turn to the only other ground of avoidance relied on by the petitioner.
It is founded on s.91 (a) and is set out in the petition in the following
terms:

"that by reason of **other circumstances** to wit, the failure of the
Commissioner of Elections (the second respondent) and/or certain members of
his staff to conduct a fair and free election, in accordance with the
provisions of the Presidential Election Act No. 15 of 1981, more particularly
set out in paragraph 9 read with paragraph 8 hereof, the majority of the said
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred".

At the preliminary hearing the respondents filed objection to this ground of
avoidance and contended that matters relied upon as consisting non-compliance
with the provisions of the Presidential Election Act and as grounds for
avoiding the election under s. 91 (b) cannot, as a matter of law, be included
as a ground for avoiding the election under s.91 (a). The Court considered
this contention in the preliminary order and overruled the objection. The
Court reasoned thus:- "In paragraphs 9 and 10 of the petition the petitioner
seeks to rely on the instances enumerated under the head of non-compliance
with the provisions of the Election Law as "other circumstances" and pleads
that by reason of their occurrence, the majority of electors were or may have
been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred". In other
words, the petitioner is also seeking to avoid the election on the ground of
avoidance set out in s.91 (a) of the Act, relying on non-compliance with the
provisions of the Election Law... The words 'other circumstances' are wide
enough to include instances of non-compliance with the law relating to the
conduct of elections. The petitioner was therefore entitled to plead instances
of non-compliance to sustain a charge under s.91 (a) of the Act". (1989 1 Sri
L.R. 240 at 281 and 282)". This ruling is very clear and is binding on us. The
trial proceeded on the basis of this ruling.

57

Mr. de Silva, however, in his closing address deviated from this ruling and
submitted that the "other circumstances" on which he relies consists not only
of the instances of "non-compliance" but also of acts of general intimidation.
In his written submissions counsel stated:- "The 2nd ground on which avoidance
of the election is also sought to be founded on the same legal provisions,
viz. s. 91 (a) but rests on a somewhat different factual basis. The factual
basis here is composed of a combination of the acts of "general intimidation"
referred to in paragraph 7 of the petition and the 'other facts and
circumstances' referred to in paragraph 9 read with paragraph 8. The
contention is that when the acts of general intimidation are taken in
conjunction with the evidence of the breakdown of electoral machinery in
various parts of the Island ... they together constitute the cause for the
majority of voters being prevented from electing the candidate of their
choice. In a sense therefore there has been an interaction of causes...". This
ground of avoidance was not formulated on the above basis in the petition and
this clearly is not the way in which it could have been understood by the
respondents having regard to the ruling in the preliminary order. We are
therefore of the view that the petitioner cannot be permitted to present a
case (at the stage of the closing address) which was not pleaded in the
petition and which is clearly contrary to the ruling given by this Court. The
"other circumstances" must necessarily be confined to the instances of "non-
compliance" pleaded in the petition.

Mr. Marapana, counsel for the 2nd respondent submitted that there are 253
instances of "non-compliance" upon which evidence has been led by the
petitioner and these relate to 253 polling stations in different parts of the
Island; this includes the 49 polling stations in the Moneragala electoral
district where the poll was declared null and void by the 2nd respondent.
There were altogether 8025 polling stations in the Island at the Presidential
election. Therefore there is no complaint in respect of 7772 polling stations.
Evidence was led in respect of only 3.1% of the total number of polling
stations.

The complaints in respect of "non-compliance" may be very broadly categorized
as follows:

(a) 96 polling stations which were either opened late or closed early and some
were opened late or closed early. It was the

58

 submission of Mr. Marapana that these acts of "noncompliance" resulted in the
loss of 288.75 polling hours which works out on an average to the loss of 2
minutes per polling station island-wide. The evidence led on behalf of the
petitioner suggestive of the effect of this "late opening" or "early closure"
was the number of persons remaining in the queue at the close of the poll (and
thus unable to vote). Having regard to the number of such voters left in the
queue at the close of the poll Mr. Marapana submitted that the total number
who were unable to vote was 4450 which constitutes 047% of the total number of
registered voters. No submissions to the contrary were made on behalf of the
petitioner.

(b) There were allegations of inadequate staff in 38 polling stations which
constitute .47% of the total number of polling stations. Mr. Marapana
submitted that having regard to the number of persons left in the queue of
voters at the close of the poll, 2915 voters were unable to cast their votes,
i.e. .031% of the total registered voters. Counsel for the petitioner made no
endeavour to challenge these figures.

(c) In 49 polling stations in the Moneragala electoral district no poll was
held at all and there were 44850 registered voters at these polling stations.
These 49 polling stations fall within the polling divisions of Bibile (8
polling stations), Moneragala (22 polling stations) and Wellawaya (19 polling
stations). Having regard to the total number of registered voters at these
polling stations and the average poll in each of the polling divisions it was
the submission of Mr. Marapana that the total number of voters "affected" is
8014. Again, there were allegations of "non-compliance" in 5 polling stations
in the Moneragala polling division and 4 polling stations in the Bibile
polling division. Mr. Marapana submitted that the number of voters "affected"
in those polling stations would be 3210. Thus the total "affectation" in
respect of voters (those unable to vote) in the Moneragala electoral district
is 11224. No submissions were made on behalf of the petitioner in this regard.

59

(d) There were 63 polling stations which were 'shifted', that is the location
was altered. Section 4 (4) which permits such 'shifting' reads thus:- "Where
due to any emergency it is necessary that the situation of any polling station
should be different from that specified in a notice published under subsection
(1), the Commissioner may cause the situation of that polling station to be
altered in such manner as he may, in his absolute discretion, determine".
While the "shifting" is not denied by the 2nd respondent, the fact that an
"emergency" had arisen was not seriously contested by the petitioner. The real
dispute relates as to whether notice was given or adequate notice was given to
the voters. In this regard Mr. Marapana led evidence of "announcements" being
made by police officers and Army personnel on mobile duty and also of notices
put up at places notified in the Gazette in terms of s.4(1). It was the
submission of Mr. Marapana that in a fair number of these 'shifted' polling
stations the voting figures themselves indicate that the voters have been
given adequate notice of the change of location. In others, the poll was very
low but this may be due to the change of location or to other factors. The
burden lies on the petitioner to establish the nexus between the alteration of
the location and the low voter turn-out. The evidence does not show that the
petitioner has discharged this burden. It was the submission of Mr. Marapana
that the "affectation" of voters consequent upon the "shifting" of polling
stations does not exceed 14495\. No submissions to the contrary were made on
behalf of the petitioner.

Apart from the above instances of "non-compliance" there were other
"incidents" at 7 polling stations:- (i) The Senior Presiding Officer at the
Ekala Maha Vidyalaya polling station (No.40) in the Ja-Ela polling division
had torn off about 25 ballot papers from 25 different books and placed them in
a bag without issuing them (Paragraph vii at page 21 of the petition). There
is no evidence as to what was done with those 25 ballot papers after they were
put into the bag. The witness who speaks to this incident says that he does
not know 'for whose benefit the S.P.O. did this". The maximum effect of this
incident is that 25 votes which should not have ,been included in the count
may have been included.

60

(ii) The Elamalpotha polling station No.18 in the Dambulla polling division
was attacked and consequently a large number of voters were unable to vote.
(Paragraph ix (a) at page 21 of the petition) This same incident has been
pleaded under the "general intimidation" charge. There is no evidence to
establish this incident. We accordingly hold that it is not proved.

(iii) At the polling station Ganhela (No. 16) in the Akuressa polling division
at about 11 a.m. a number of persons came in 3 jeeps and forcibly obtained
from the Senior Presiding Officer 25 ballot books containing 1250 ballot
papers and the marked ballot papers were put into the ballot box. (Paragraph x
(b) at page 22 of the petition) This incident was not challenged. There is no
evidence to show in whose favour the ballot papers were marked. Nor is there
evidence to indicate compliance with s. 35 (2) (c) of the Act. If there was no
such compliance the probabilities are that the ballot papers would have been
rejected by the counting officer - vide s. 51 (1) (a). It is doubtful whether
this incident would constitute an instance of noncompliance. Here again no
submissions were made by counsel for the petitioner. The evidence does not
establish that the "result" may have been affected.

(iv) At the polling station at the Minhath Maha Vidyalaya, Dickwella (No.38)
in the Devinuwara polling division around 12 noon about 10 unauthorised
persons entered the polling booth and forcibly obtained 12 ballot books,
containing 600 ballot papers, each of which was then marked with a cross and
put into the ballot box. (Paragraph x (c) at page 22 of the petition) The
evidence here was that the ballot papers were marked in favour of the UNP
There is no record of this incident in the journal P31. However, there is
sufficient evidence to establish this incident and we accordingly hold that
the incident has been proved. The "affectation" here would amount to 600
votes.

(v) At the Bambarawewa polling station (No.16) in the Ampara polling division
50 ballot papers in excess of the number of voters who came to cast their vote
were found in the ballot boxes. (Paragraph xiv, page 24 of the petition) One
witness was called to testify to this incident but his evidence does not show
that there were

61

 50 ballot papers in excess. We are of the view that this incident has not
been proved.

(vi) No ballot boxes reached the Dikwewa polling station in the Kalawewa
polling division. (Paragraph d (ii) at page 34 of the petition) This
allegation is not proved in view of the evidence of Dassanayake, the
Government Agent, Anuradhapura, who stated that on the morning of 19th
December this polling station was shifted to Maha Illuppalama for security
reasons.

(vii) At the S. Thomas' College polling station (No.17) in the Bandarawela
polling division around 2.30 p.m. a number of unauthorised persons forcibly
entered the polling booth and forcibly obtained the petitioner's polling
agent's list of voters and shouted at the voters to vote for another party.
(Paragraph xviii (b) at page 35 of the petition) Witness Somawathie the SLFP
polling agent stated in cross-examination that as a result of this incident no
voters were prevented from voting and that everyone present was able to vote.
By reason of the incident no adverse consequences were thus established.

We pass on to the more general allegation of "non-compliance" set out at
paragraphs 8 (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) of the petition. (No evidence was led in
respect of paragraph (ii).

Paragraph 8 (i) avers that the 2nd respondent failed to comply with the
provisions of s. 21 (2) of the Act and in accordance therewith appoint another
date for the taking of the poll in the electoral districts of Matale, Matara,
Hambantota, Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa, and Moneragala notwithstanding the
outbreak of widespread violence for many days prior to the election and on
election day. In considering this allegation, it has to be borne in mind that
the Constitution and the Presidential Elections Act stipulate a period of time
within which the election has to be held. In accordance with the provisions of
Article. 31 (3) of the Constitution the last date for the poll would have been
3rd January 1989. Thus the 2nd respondent could not have postponed the holding
of the poll in any electoral district beyond 03.01.89, that is, for a period
of not more than 15 days. See also s.21 (2) of the Act. What is of relevance
for present purposes is that there

62

is no evidence to show that the climate of terror alleged in these electoral
districts would have declined and the situation would have improved between
19.12.88 and 03.01.89. Nor is there any evidence to indicate that the 2nd
respondent had reasonable grounds to believe that the violence would be less
within a period of 15 days. In view of the time limit within which the poll
had to be held, the petitioner must show that the 2nd respondent had reason to
believe that had he postponed the poll for any date before 04.01.89 there was
a reasonable prospect of the situation improving. We find no such evidence on
record. Nor is there evidence that an application was made for the
postponement of the poll. On the other hand, Mr. Marapana submitted that the
voter turn-out in the electoral districts of Matara and Hambantota decreased
by February 1989, indicating an escalation of violence. We accordingly hold
that there is no basis for the alleged "non-compliance".

Paragraph 8 (iii) avers that the 2nd respondent declared null and void the
polling in 49 polling stations in the Moneragala electoral district without
naming them and that he failed to comply with s.46A of the Act. The fact that
the poll was cancelled in 49 polling stations is not contested. Mr. Marapana
contests the allegation that the 2nd respondent failed to comply with s.46A of
the Act. The document 213 27 marked without objection at the trial clearly
establishes that the 2nd respondent consulted the election agent of the
petitioner as provided for in s.46A(8) of the Act. Paragraph 1 of 2R 27
states, inter alia, that "This meeting is specially convened in conformity
with s.46A of the Elections (Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1988".
Paragraph 8 of 2R 27 reads thus:- "Both Mr. Ranjan Wijeratne and Dr. Mackie
Ratwatte agreed with the views expressed by the Commissioner of Elections,
that what would have polled, could not make a difference to the result". The
election agent of the petitioner having thus agreed, it is not open to the
petitioner to complain now. We accordingly hold that there is no basis for
this alleged instance of "non-compliance."

Paragraph 8(iv) deals with postal votes. The allegation is that the 2nd
respondent failed to act in accordance with the provisions of s.23 and in
consequence "a number of persons who had the right to vote by post were unable
to vote at this election, and the votes of a large number of persons who voted
by post were not counted at the

63

counting centres". No evidence was led in respect of "postal voting" in the
Colombo, Gampaha, Nuwara Eliya and Ratnapura electoral districts. The evidence
adduced in the Kandy, Matale, Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Wanni, Batticaloa,
Digamadulla, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Moneragala and
Kegalle electoral districts does not prove the allegation contained in the
petition. The evidence led in regard to the Kurunegala and Badulla Electoral
districts shows that no postal ballot papers were issued at all. The evidence
does not indicate how the "non-compliance" may have affected the result of the
election. No submissions whatever were made by counsel for the petitioner in
respect of "postal voting". We accordingly hold that the allegation as pleaded
has not been proved.

Paragraph 8(v) refers to the failure to ensure that official poll cards were
sent to all registered voters as required by s.24 of the Act. The allegation
is that "as a result a large number of voters were prevented from voting". The
evidence is that in many polling divisions poll cards could not be issued
owing to the prevailing situation. It is also in evidence that the absence of
a poll card does not mean that a voter is denied the right to vote. The
Government Agent, Kandy, in his evidence stated as follows:

Q. It is not a requirement that a voter should be in possession of a ballot
(sic) card in order to cast his vote at the polling station?

A. That is so.

Q. Apart from the date of the poll the other particulars stated in the poll
card are also available in the voters' electoral lists?

A. Yes.

Q. And these electoral lists are available to the candidates and their agents?

A. Yes.

Q. It is the practice as far as possible or convenient to continue using the
same location for a polling station ... ?

64

A. Yes.

Q. By which (sic) the voters know their polling stations quite independently
of receiving polling cards?

A. It is generally known.

Q. Are you aware that the Commissioner of Elections caused radio announcements
to be made of the fact that a voter was entitled to vote although he was not
in possession of a polling card?

A. Yes.

Q. The message was announced or telecast on the Rupavahani also?

A. Yes.

There is no evidence to show that any voter was unable to cast his vote
because he had no poll card. Nor is there evidence to indicate that a voter
did not know the situation of the polling station because he did not get a
poll card. In short, there is no evidence to suggest that the result may have
been affected on account of the failure to issue poll cards. The allegation as
pleaded has not been established.

We have set out above the main instances of "non-compliance" relied on by the
petitioner as "other circumstances" in terms of s.91(a) of the Act. We have
already, held, in accordance with the ruling of this Court in the preliminary
order, that the burden is on the petitioner to prove that by reason of the
"other circumstances" the result of the election may have been affected. This,
the petitioner has failed to do; the evidence falls short of the required
proof. In the result the second ground of avoidance relied on also fails. The
petition is accordingly dismissed with costs.

In terms of s.98 of the Presidential Elections Act No.15 of 1981, we determine
that the 1st respondent was duly elected.

This is perhaps the longest trial held in this country. It continued for no
less than 3 years. In this, not altogether easy case, we received the full and
complete assistance from all the counsel appearing for

65

the petitioner and the two respondents. We wish to place on record our deep
appreciation of the comprehensive and cogent written submissions on the law
given by Mr. H. L. de Silva and the carefully prepared, well-documented, and
meticulously-arranged summary of the evidence handed over by Mr. Choksy as
well as Mr. Marapana. These, considerably lightened the burden that lay on us.

The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka provides
for the office of The President of the Republic who is described in Article 30
(1) as the Head of State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government and
the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. As the term of office of the then
President was due to expire on the 4th day of February 1989, the poll for the
election of a President had, as required by Article 31(8) of the Constitution,
to be conducted not less than one month and not more than two months before
that date. The poll was fixed for and the election conducted on the 19th day
of December 1988, a date which fell within the limits prescribed, and the
three candidates who contested were, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri
Lanka Freedom Party the petitioner, Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa of the United
National Party the 1st Respondent, and Mr. Oswin Abeygunasekera of the Sri
Lanka Mahajana Party, no party in these proceedings.

The electorate for the purposes of the election was the whole country and, as
required by section 3 (2) of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981
(which is the principal statute governing the holding of an election of the
President), divided into electoral districts and further subdivided into
polling divisions and polling districts. As we were made to understand, the
area of each such polling district broadly corresponded to the area served by
a polling booth or to use another term, a polling station. There were 22
electoral districts, 159 polling divisions and 8025 polling districts.

66

The result of the election was declared by the 2nd Respondent the Commissioner
of Elections in terms of section 56(2) of the Presidential Elections Act, that
the 1st respondent was the candidate elected to the office of President and
such result was duly published in the Government Gazette (Extraordinary)
bearing No. 537/3 dated 21.12.1988 thus:

Oswin Abeygunasekera | 235719 |  4.63%  
---|---|---  
Sirimavo Bandaranaike |  2289860 | 44.95%  
R. Premadasa  | 2569199 |  50.43%  
Valid Votes |  5094778 |  
Rejected Votes |  91445 |  
Total Polled |  5186223 |  
Majority |  279339 |  
Total Registered Votes |  9375742 |  
Total polled/Registered Votes |   |   55.32%  
  
 On the 9th day of January 1989, the petitioner Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, an
unsuccessful candidate at this election, filed this petition seeking a
declaration by this Court that the election of the 1st respondent is void
and/or undue. The broad grounds on which she has sought this relief, and
particularised in detail thereafter in her petition in paragraphs 7,8 and 9
respectively, are contained in paragraphs 6A, 6B and 6C. They read thus:

6 (A) That by reason of the occurrence of the incidents, hereinafter mentioned
and the commission of the acts hereinafter specified in paragraph 7 hereof,
there was general intimidation of the electors at the aforesaid election in
consequence of which the majority of the said electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred.

6 (B) That by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of the Presidential
Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 (as amended) the aforesaid election was not
conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the said provisions
and as hereinafter specified and as particularised in paragraph 8 hereof,
which acts of non-compliance affected the result of the election and the said
election is in consequence null and void.

67

6 (C) That by reason of other circumstances to wit, the failure of the
Commissioner of Elections (the 2nd respondent) and/or certain members of his
staff to conduct a fair and free election, in accordance with the provisions
of the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 more particularly set out in
paragraph 9 read with section 8 hereof, the majority of the said electors were
or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred.

Section 91 of the Presidential Elections Act, inter alia in subsections (a)
and (b) provides that, on an election petition, the election of a candidate to
the office of President shall be declared to be void by the Supreme Court, if
the following grounds are proved to Court's satisfaction

(a) that by reason of general bribery, general treating or general
intimidation or other misconduct, or other circumstances, whether similar to
those before enumerated or not, the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred.

(b) non-compliance with the provisions of this Act relating to elections if it
appears that the election was not conducted in accordance with the principles
laid down in such provisions and that such non-compliance affected the result
of the election.

The allegations contained in any of the paragraphs 6A, 6B or 6C of the
petition, if successfully established according to law, would affect the 1st
respondent and no doubt therefore they are all of concern to him, but the case
he was called upon to meet upon the petition is contained in the said
paragraph 6A.

The case the 2nd respondent the Commissioner of Elections was called upon to
meet upon the petition however is contained in the other two paragraphs 6B and
6C of the petition.

The petitioner's case in this petition as contained in paragraph 6A of her
petition, being that founded upon general intimidation as particularised in
paragraph 7 of such petition, falls to be decided by

68

reference to the provisions of section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections
Act.

The petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6B of her petition is based
upon the provisions of section 91(b), of the Presidential Elections Act and
relates to complaints of non-compliance with the provisions of the elections
law as particularised in paragraph 8 of her petition, the general heading of
which reads "Non-Compliance with Provisions of Elections Law".

The petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6 C of her petition is that
the cumulative effect of all or a substantial number of the instances and
transactions enumerated in paragraph 8 was to prevent, in the manner set out
in paragraph 9 of the petition, a free and fair election being held and that
by reason of their occurrence, there was another "circumstance" whereby the
majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, thus constituting a ground of avoidance of the
election also under the provisions of section 91(a) of the Presidential
Elections Act.

Before the evidence at the trial commenced, certain preliminary objections as
to the maintainability of the petition as constituted, founded upon a claim of
inadequacy of pleadings, had been raised on behalf of both respondents, and in
holding that the petition was maintainable in the form constituted, this Court
examined the provisions of sections 91(a) and (b) of the said Act. The order
with respect to those objections is to be found reported sub .nom.
Bandaranaike v. Premadasa in (1989) 1 Sri Lanka Law Reports page 240\. I will
at this stage proceed to mention in outline, the questions around which these
objections had been examined, in particular the submissions of Mr. H. L. de
Silva, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner, so that the general
nature of such objections as well, insofar as that is necessary to be done,
will also become apparent.

As regards the allegation of general intimidation relied on by the petitioner
as contained in paragraph 6A of her petition, the contention on her behalf, as
far as I can gather from the order on the preliminary objections, had been
that the inclusion of section 91(a) in the

69

Presidential Elections Act was the way in which the concept of the English
common law, of a free and fair election had been introduced into the statute.
The argument put forward appears to have taken the form (though learned
Counsel for the petitioner .did submit that certain important aspects of his
submissions are not reflected in the Court's order) that if proof could be
adduced of general intimidation, which by reason of its magnitude deprived the
electors of a free and fair election, it is possible to say then, that the
majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred, and consequently that the Court is not called upon to enter
upon the independent exercise of determining whether there is proof before it
that the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred (implying the success of some other candidate),
and that this is a matter not capable of proof in any accurate sense. The
argument adopted, as one can gather from the Court's order, appears to have
been on these lines, that if general intimidation is established and as a
consequence a large number of voters are shown to have refrained from voting,
the necessary inference is that the majority of electors may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred and therefore what
the petitioner had to prove was the existence of that degree of general
intimidation which made a substantial number of voters keep away from the
polls, thus eliminating free choice.

In its order on the preliminary objections, the Court, in examining the
English common law concept of a free and fair election in the context of
general intimidation, posed to itself (at p. 259) a question thus:- "The
question arises whether s. 91 (a) of the Act embodies what Mr. H. L. de Silva
P.C. described as 'the pure and unadulterated English Common Law prior to
1949' or as Mr. Choksy submitted 'that in addition to general intimidation
etc., something more has to be proved' by the petitioner to have an election
avoided under section 91(a)". The Court answered this question (at page 262)
so far as I see, in the following terms:- "The case of the petitioner based on
the ground of avoidance under section 91(a) falls to be determined solely by a
consideration and application of the provisions contained in section 91(a)".
The Court also said (at page 261) "We agree with Mr. Choksy that mere proof of
several instances or acts of general

70

intimidation would not suffice to avoid an election. In addition the
petitioner has to prove that these several acts or instances had the result or
consequence that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred." The Court also posed to itself
(at page 264) the following question "What is the meaning of the expression
'the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred' ". It answered such question (at page 270) in
this form: "In a case of general intimidation, the question that arises is,
from the proved acts of intimidation of electors, is it reasonable to suppose
that the result of the election may have been affected? This it seems to us to
be the true meaning of the words, 'the majority of electors may have been
prevented from electing the candidate they preferred' ". The following words
the Court then immediately proceeded to add "But it will be open to the
returned candidate to show that the gross intimidation could not possibly have
affected the result of the election".

With respect to the case of the petitioner as directed against the 2nd
respondent on the ground of non-compliance with the provisions of the
elections law, the submission made on her behalf at the inquiry into the
preliminary objections had been that upon a reading of section 91(b), it is
apparent that there is no burden cast on her to establish that the result of
the election had been affected and that therefore proof of such affectation is
not an essential ingredient of the ground of avoidance contained in such
section. The tenor of this contention had been that when-section 91(b) refers
to "the result of the election"' such reference can only be to a valid
election and that when the magnitude and extent of the non-compliance is to
such a degree as to render the election a sham, the result goes with it. The
key to the interpretation of section 91(b), it had been argued, is to be found
in section 115 of the Act which is a provision guaranteeing protection to the
returned candidate and therefore that both provisions had to be read together
and interpreted in a manner consistent with each other. The resultant
submission therefore had been that the words in section 91(b) which read "if
it appears that the

71

election was not conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in such
provisions and that such non-compliance affected the result of the election,"
had to be read to mean, " if it appears that the election was not conducted in
accordance with the principles laid down in such provisions or that such non-
compliance affected the result of the election". The Court upon an examination
of earlier legislation on similar lines and a consideration of the relevant
authorities concluded that it was not permissible to substitute the word "or"
for the word "and" in that manner, and held that proof of affectation of the
result was indeed an essential ingredient of the ground set out in section 91
(b) of the Presidential Elections Act.

At the stage of the final addresses in the case, learned Counsel for the
petitioner Mr. H. L. de Silva contended that, as regards the case of the
petitioner based upon section 91(a) where reliance was placed on general
intimidation, while not challenging the Court's earlier order or seeking its
review, certain portions of such order required clarification and that he
would endeavour to demonstrate how they should properly be understood and that
if so done, it would support his position. On the other hand learned Counsel
for the 1st respondent, Mr. Choksy objected to any endeavour to reagitate the
questions decided upon by the Court's earlier order, particularly that portion
of it which, in his submission, said that there was cast upon the petitioner
the burden of proving that the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, which in essence he
claimed, suggested an affectation of the result of the election, meaning a
return of the wrong candidate. In point of fact, as if in anticipation of such
a possibility, Mr. Choksy, at the stage at which he was addressing the Court,
submitted that such a course should not be permitted.

With respect to the ground of avoidance based upon section 91 (b) of the
Presidential Elections Act and founded upon a claim of noncompliance with the
elections law, Mr. H. L. de Silva's position was that he was "abandoning his
case". He submitted that he was adopting that course by reason of the Court's
decision with respect to the preliminary objections, that when this ground of
avoidance is invoked, it must be proved affirmatively that the result of the
election was affected, a virtually impossible burden as he suggested, and to
discharge which there was no evidence in the case, as he impliedly conceded.

72

Mr. H. L. de Silva adopted a new approach to the case of the petitioner
directed against the 2nd respondent, the Commissioner of Elections, on the
basis of a failure to conduct a fair and free election in accordance with the
elections law as a ground of avoidance under section 91(a) of the Presidential
Elections Act, an approach new in the sense that it was not the position taken
up in the petition, as he indeed had to concede. He argued that non-compliance
with the elections law was broadly, and subject to one exception (there was
however no clear statement as to what this exception was based on, nor any
submissions made connected therewith), not something for which the 2nd
respondent was accountable or responsible but that the acts of general
intimidation complained of, resulted in a breakdown of the machinery of
election on a large scale so that the instances of such breakdown as pleaded,
taken in conjunction with the general intimidation which led to such
breakdown, was another "circumstance", as that word is used in section 91(a)
of the Presidential Elections Act and constituting a basis of avoidance
thereunder. I will deal with this aspect of his submissions at an appropriate
stage later on.

The contention of Mr. H. L. de Silva as to the question of general
intimidation relied on as a basis of avoidance of the election, standing by
itself and without link to the pleaded items of noncompliance with the
elections law is, as I see it, much the most important aspect of the
petitioner's case. Whether as claimed, what was done by him can be described
as an exercise calculated to achieve a true understanding of the Court's order
on the preliminary objections or whether, as was suggested by the reaction of
opposing counsel, it was in reality an attempt at reagitating some of the
legal questions upon which the Court had already ruled, I am of the view that
the situation is one that can be dealt with, without embarking upon a separate
examination directed at resolving that initial question. The approach that
commends itself to me as a satisfactory one and one appropriate in the
circumstances of this case is thus: The foundation upon which Mr. H. L. de
Silva sought to rest the case of the petitioner on this aspect is, that the
expression in section 91(a), "the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred", does not mean what
Mr. Choksy contended to be its meaning, which is that the result of

73

the election was affected implying thereby the return of the wrong candidate.
I will hence first deal with the petitioner's case as if these words connote
that which has been contended on her behalf to mean. Thereafter I will
endeavour to ascertain what this expression means, as I read and understand
it, and in doing so attempt to interpret what the Court intended these words
to mean in its order on the preliminary objections. Adopting such a course
would have the advantage of producing a final judgment arrived at, at the end
of the case, clarifying the issues upon the decisions of which the result of
the case must be made to rest and which are seen at that concluding stage to
arise with respect to all material propositions upon which the parties may be
seen to be at variance, not forgetting that this is the Court both of first
and last instance, disposing of a matter which, notwithstanding its public
interest dimension, has a good many of the attributes of a its inter partes.
Additionally I feel that these submissions involve questions of a serious and
important nature which deserve consideration.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, as I understood him, asserted what I will now proceed to
outline, but before doing so, in order to avoid confusion as to whether there
is an intermix therewith of my own observations, 1 Would make clear here that
this paragraph will be confined entirely to what he has said. He submitted
thus:- The concept of a free and fair election as known to the English common
law before The Representation of The People Act 1949 introduced certain
significant changes, is what is embodied in section 91 (a) of The Presidential
Elections Act. The pivotal question (Mr. H. L. de Silva's words) is therefore
as to the correct interpretation of section 91 (a). The concept embodies the
right to choose freely and that presupposes a choice to be exercised without,
duress, coercion or intimidation. The case of the petitioner is rested on a
twofold basis of fact (as Mr. H. L. de Silva described it), but on a single
legal ground. Therefore, to ensure the petitioner's success upon a proper
discharge of the burden placed on her by section 91 (a), the following have to
be established, namely, (a) the existence of a situation where a significant
number of voters were prevented from voting at the election, which number
should necessarily be numerically greater than the majority of votes secured
by the 1st respondent, the returned candidate, which implies therefore that if
this number is numerically

74

less, the election cannot be avoided, (b) that these persons who were
prevented from exercising their right to vote were so prevented, irrespective
of the question of which candidate they would have voted for, had they not
been so prevented, and (c) that they were so prevented from voting by acts of
general intimidation (that is undue influence, coercion, duress etc) of such a
nature as would have been sufficient to deter persons of ordinary courage from
voting and that they were thereby prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred. If these elements are established, then, irrespective of the
question as to whom such acts of intimidation were directed at, irrespective
of the question as to who the voters were, who were so prevented, that is
whether they happened to be supporters of the returned candidate or on the
other hand supporters of either of the other two candidates, irrespective of
the question for whom they would have cast their votes, had they been free to
vote, such proof constitutes a sufficient basis for avoidance of the election
under section 91 (a) of the Act. Once these constituent elements are
established the inevitable consequence is that the majority of the electors
are shown to have, as a matter of possibility, been prevented from electing
the candidate whom they preferred, whoever that candidate might be. The other
basis of avoidance relied on is the large-scale breakdown of the electoral
machinery which, when taken in conjunction with the acts of intimidation
established, together constitute another cause for the majority of voters
being prevented from electing the candidate of their choice, once again
constituting a ground of avoidance under section 91 (a) of the Act. It is
reasonable to suppose that had it not been for these causes the voter turn-out
would have been around 80% of the total number of registered voters so that
there was a consequent shortfall of about two and a half million votes. The
evidence establishes that the 1st respondent had a majority of about 280,000
votes over those of the petitioner, and taking account of the amounts of these
two figures it is clearly seen that those deprived of voting numbered six or
seven times the majority secured by the 1st respondent over the petitioner,
the runner-up. In that situation it is reasonable to conclude that the result
"may have been different" in the sense that the majority of electors may have
been prevented from electing the candidate of their choice, whoever that might
have been. The point of divergence between the respective positions of the
parties is as to whether there is, or there is

75

not, another requirement that it was incumbent upon the petitioner to
establish apart from the factors already mentioned, (which factors are the
acts of general intimidation committed together with the demonstrated
instances of the malfunctioning or breakdown of the electoral machinery and
the natural consequence flowing therefrom which brought about the result that
voters were unable to vote, and the extent or magnitude of the resultant loss
of votes being so considerable that the result may well have been affected had
all the non-voters cast their votes), yet another factor, which is that the
result of the election may have been affected, in the sense that but for these
acts another candidate other than the one declared returned would have been
successful. Such an exercise to determine whether such an additional element
exists would involve a computation of numbers which necessarily must be based
upon conjecture and surmise, being depended upon circumstance totally
different and unpredictable, and therefore not something that the section
could reasonably be thought to-demand. The Court in any event would be
precluded from entering upon any such exercise by reason of the right to
secrecy of voting which is ensured to all, not only by virtue of the relevant
constitutional provisions and many provisions in the Presidential Elections
Act, but also because any such exercise by violating one of its essential
components would erode the common law concept of a free and fair election,
which has found expression in section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections
Act. In these circumstances the petitioner's contention is that there is no
burden cast upon her to show that, but for the acts complained of, either that
she would have been the successful candidate or that someone other than the
1st respondent would have been the successful one.

I have here in broad outline endeavoured to set out what I have been able to
understand to be the position taken by learned Counsel for the petitioner.

Before considering what Mr. H. L. de Silva said as to the case the petitioner
has presented with respect to general intimidation, I find it convenient to
make reference to what he relied on as a finding in his favour contained in
the order on the preliminary objections which he claimed had the consequence
that there was no requirement under

76

section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act that calls upon the
petitioner to establish that the result of the election was affected, in the
sense of the success of another candidate other than the one declared elected.

Mr. H. L. de Silva's submissions thereon were thus. Each of the respondents
contended that the petition was defective, in that it contained no plea as to
what the petitoner's position was as regards the 45% of voters who did not
vote at this election (55% having actually voted), that is whether such
contention was that if they had in fact voted, they would have voted for her.
The Court, he contended, held that there was no need to so plead, and since
section 96 (c) of the Act demands that all material facts be pleaded, what is
implicit in that ruling is that it was not a material fact that had to be
proved as to how that 45%, if they could have voted, would in fact have voted.
Since the Court, he argued, therefore considered that it was not a material
fact, it could not be a requirement of the section, and therefore it was not a
part of the burden cast upon the petitioner to show for which candidate the
voters who did not vote would have voted, had they the opportunity of doing
so, and hence the section in no way demands that the petitioner has to
establish that the result of the election was affected, in the sense that some
other candidate other than the one declared elected would have been
successful. This process of reasoning which learned Counsel adopted is
something, I find I am unable to go along with. The Court said (at page 268)
"In our opinion, how the majority were or may have been preyented from
electing the candidate of their choice need not be specially pleaded". The
inclusion here of the word "specially" must have the usual significance it
would convey when used in a context such as this and would suggest no sense
different from "expressly" (as opposed to "impliedly"). Other passages in the
order militate against the view that this passage was intended to do more than
state that as a **matter of pleadings** , there need be no express averment of
this. Examples of such passages are thus:- "(The requirement that the
petition) shall contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the
petitioner relies" was "intended to secure that a respondent will know from
the petition itself what facts the petitioner proposes to prove in order to
avoid the election and will thus have a proper opportunity to prepare for the
trial... The term material facts has a plain meaning in the context of
requirements

77

relating to pleadings, namely facts material to establish a party's case". (at
page 263 of the order on the preliminary objections); "The object of the
requirement (as to what should be pleaded) is clearly to enable the opposite
party to prepare his case for the trial so that he may not be taken by
surprise." (p. 263). The passage then (at page 268) that reads "The petitioner
has, in her petition pleaded that the general intimidation had this effect
(that is that the majority were or may, have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred). In our opinion, how the majority were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate of their choice, need not be
specially pleaded", must be understood, as I read these words, to limit the
question that the Court was concerned with at that stage, to the adequacy or
inadequacy of the pleadings.

As can be gathered from these passages, and in the circumstances of this case
I do not see it as a necessary conclusion derived from any process of legal
reasoning to say that the petitioner was not required to establish this
requirement by reason only of the Court having said that there was no need for
a special plea in the way contended for the respondents, although generally as
a matter of pleadings, what has to be proved may well have to be pleaded. The
Court exempted the petitioner only from pleading the requirement, specially,
or expressly, as a prerequisite to proving it, and that too in the
circumstances of the case, having regard to what the petition already
contained. When the Court ruled that the petitioner did not have to aver how
the majority were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate of
their choice, it does not mean as claimed, that the Court thereby rejected a
submission that there was an obligation to prove, either as a certainty or as
a probability, how the voters who were prevented from voting would have voted
at this election had they the opportunity of doing so. I do not think that
such was the conclusion which the Court reached as that contended by Mr. H. L.
de Silva and I therefore cannot, for myself, conclude that what is stated
merely as a matter pertaining to pleadings, can be extended in this way so as
to say that what is implied is as to what does not require to be proved. I
therefore see no warrant for arriving at a conclusion that this passage relied
on by Mr. H. L. de Silva can be read to mean that the Court ruled that there
was no burden cast upon the petitioner in that regard. Indeed the Court has
not said so and I do not imagine that the Court would have intended to say so.

78

Furthermore, in the course of his submissions regarding what he termed a
clarification of certain aspects of the Court's order on the preliminary
objections, Mr. H. L. de Silva was heard to say something to the effect that
the ratio decidendi of the order which is what is of binding force, had to be
arrived at by reference to the questions in issue at that stage before the
Court, in the sense of those upon which the Court had to rule, and that was as
to the adequacy or inadequacy of the matters pleaded, that is whether in the
state of the pleadings as they were to be found, further proceedings upon the
petition could or could not be continued. How therefore, it is possible to
reconcile the statement that the ratio decidendi had to be construed in the
way so argued, with this further submission that the Court held that there was
no burden cast upon the petitioner as respects proof of this matter, which is
that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing
the candidate they preferred as meaning that the result of the election was
affected, is something I do not clearly understand. Indeed having regard to
the approach I have adopted, it is not possible for me to draw the inference
we were called upon to draw, there being not a single statement in the Court's
order that there is no such legal requirement under section 91 (a) of the
Presidential Elections Act.

It is convenient to get out of the way one other matter. In the course of his
submissions Mr. H. L. de Silva emphasized that an integral aspect of the right
to a free and fair election is the right to voting by secret ballot. Learned
counsel used the word "precluded", with reference to any possible exercise the
Court might indulge in, directed towards ascertaining, if I mistake not,
whether any other candidate would have been the successful one had the acts
complained of not been present, and in that context asserted that the
principal obstruction to such a course would be the barrier erected by the
voters' right to the secrecy of the ballot. It is therefore useful to see
whether the common law concept of a free and fair election as understood in
England before The Representation of the People Act 1949, demanded as an
essential requisite or component thereof, the right to vote secretly. I do
certainly understand that the constitutional and other statutory provisions of
our law; assure such a right to voters. But the question my inquiry is
directed to is as to whether this right of voting by secret ballot, if taken
away, would result in an

79

erosion of the common law concept of a free and fair election, which, of
course, is the same as asking whether such a right is demanded as an integral
part of that concept, which if I mistake not, is the effect of what Mr. H. L.
de Silva claimed. Having regard to the submission that section 91 (a) is a
statutory embodiment of the common law concept of a free and fair election, if
the right to secrecy of voting is not part to that common law concept, apart
from such assurances of a right to secrecy of voting granted by other
provisions, it could not be considered a requirement implicit in the section
itself. The best approach I think to such a question is by reference to the
judgment of _Lord Denning M. R. in the case of Morgan v. Simpson_ (14). A
quotation from that judgment (at pp. 725 and 726), other than as a matter of
interest, bears repetition here because it helps to understand the background
against which the early cases particularly those decided before the Ballot Act
1872, some of which I will refer to subsequently, had been decided. Lord
Denning said:

"The common law method of election was by show of hands. But if a poll was
demanded the election was by poll: see _Anthony v. Seger_ (15). A poll was
taken in this way. The returning officer or his clerk had a book in which he
kept a record of the votes cast. Each voter went up to the clerk, gave his
name and stated his qualification. The clerk wrote down his name. The voter
stated the candidate for whom he voted. The poll clerk recorded his vote.
(Sometimes the voter went up with a card on which the particulars were
written, and these were written down by the poll clerk). After the poll was
concluded, the votes were counted and the result announced. But the poll book
was open to inspection. Then, if required, there was a scrutiny at which the
vote could be challenged, for example by showing a voter was not qualified to
vote. In that event his vote was not counted. So the result was decided
according to the number of votes cast which were valid votes. Sometimes the
returning officer or his clerk might refuse to record some of the votes
without good cause. If it were found that the rejected votes would have given
a different result the election would be vitiated: see _Faulkner v Elger_
(16). If they would not have affected the

80

result, the election was good, but the rejected voter could have an action for
damages against the returning officer: see _Ashby v. White_ (17).

Such was the method of election at common law. It was open. Not by secret
ballot. Being open, it was disgraced by abuses of several kind, especially at
Parliamentary Elections. Bribery, corruption, treating, personation, were
rampant. These were not investigated by the Courts of law. They were the
subjects of petition to Parliament itself. Often members were unseated and
elections declared invalid. If you should wish to know what happened, you will
find it in Power, Rodwell II & Drew's reports of controverted elections (Power
Rodwell & Drews Election Cases 1848-1858 Vols. I & 2) and in Charles Dicken's
Account of the Election on Eatanswill (The Pickwick Papers ch.13).

In 1868 the judges were brought in for the first time. By the Parliamentary
Elections Act 1868 a petition to unseat a member was to be tried by a judge of
one of the superior Courts. He was to make a report to the Speaker: and his
report had the same effect as that of an election committee previously. After
that Act, the judges tried many election petitions. Nearly all of them were
for bribery and corruption, and treating. Most of them will be found in
O'Malley & Hardcastle's Reports (O' Malley & Hardcastle Election cases
1869-1934)...

Then in 1872 Parliament passed the Ballot Act 1872. It revolutionized the
system of voting at elections. It provided for voting by secret ballot".

A major objective of the change which was to introduce voting by secret ballot
had apparently been to eliminate the unsatisfactory features of the earlier
common law system of voting by show of hands. I do not understand that the
object of that change was to supply a missing component in the common law
concept of a free

81

and fair election, so as to complete and perfect an otherwise perfect concept,
incomplete by reason of the absence of this right of voting by secret ballot.
Indeed even the Ballot Act 1972 which for the first time introduced in England
the system of voting by secret ballot, did not ensure total secrecy to the
degree that appeared to be contended for it of being the basis of the freedom
of franchise. That Act itself contained a provision to enable a voter to be
asked how he voted, upon a scrutiny after a vote had been declared invalid.
(Vide the observations of Grove J. in the Hackney Case 2 O' M & H 77 at page
81).

Against a background of what I have said as to the position regarding the
method of voting under the common law which was as pointed out by show of
hands, I will now make reference to some of the early cases which will show
that the concept of a free and fair election was much in the minds of the
judges and recognised and given effect to as a concept full in all important
respects, even when there was no secrecy of voting. A reproduction of excerpts
from the judgments in such cases will also help to understand the true and
full meaning of the concept as the judges who, decided these cases understood
it, and here it must be pointed out that learned Counsel for the petitioner on
many an occasion cited passages from such cases as embodying the concept in
all its dimensions.

The _Drogheda Case_ (18) was decided in 1869 before the **Ballot Act 1872**
became law. The allegation in that case pertaining to general intimidation as
contained in the petition was that its object was to secure the success of the
candidate who was declared elected. The contention of Counsel for the
respondent had been that if an organised and general system of intimidation
was proved, still before setting the election aside on such a ground, that it
was necessary to establish that such intimidation, however excessive it might
have been, had a substantial influence on the fate of the election. In
elaboration of that argument it had been the submission of Counsel that
provided the respondent had an actual majority of registered electors, however
small it was, then no matter what happened outside, no matter how many voters
were assaulted and driven from the polling booth, no matter how many voters
were compelled to go by devious ways in order to get back to their homes,

82

no matter how much blood was shed, no matter how much spiritual intimidation
had been brought to bear upon the electors, still if the candidate who was
returned could say that there were 1000 electors in the Borough and no matter
how, he had polled 501 of them, his election cannot be declared void on the
ground of general intimidation, although the unsuccessful candidate may, upon
a scrutiny, by striking off individual votes on this ground show that, but for
the general intimidation he would have had a majority. Mr. Justice Keogh in
his judgment responded to that argument thus:

"I must say at once that the argument put forward by the Respondent is one
from which I wholly and entirely dissent. It is subversive, in my mind, of the
whole principle of freedom of election. It is said by the Counsel for the
Respondents, that freedom of election is secured provided the majority are
shown to have had the power of recording their votes, I deny that altogether.
This was not solely a contest between the Respondent and the Petitioner. There
is another and greater interest than belongs to either of them; there is the
public interest. The humblest individual in the whole of the constituency has
as good a right without fear or intimidation to come into the Court-house upon
the day of the election as the richest man upon the register, and as good a
right as the great majority of the constituency. Take it that a candidate has
by the most legitimate means obtained the votes of nine-tenths of the
constituency in his favour, yet it is of vital importance to the public weal
that the remaining tenth should be able to record their votes and to express
their opinions. If the majority are not only to send their own representative
to Parliament, as of course the majority must do, but if they are to drive by
terror and with ignominy and with scorn and with denunciation the minority
from the poll, what becomes of freedom to this country? ...

But I take it to be well settled law ... that an organised system either of
bribery or of treating will invalidate an election.

.......to put general intimidation upon a parallel with general bribery or
general treating, it must be shown to spread over such an extent of ground,
and to permeate through the community to such an extent that the tribunal
considering the

83

case is satisfied, if it be so, that freedom of election has ceased to exist
in consequence. If that be the case, I for my part see no distinction between
an organised system of bribery, an organised system of treating, and an
organised system of intimidation.'

It is well not to overlook here, firstly, that the method of voting by secret
ballot had not yet become law and secondly, that the allegation in the case
was that general intimidation of a widespread nature was calculated to benefit
a particular candidate.

The _Bradford Case_ (19) decided in 1859, again emphasized that by the common
law, that is law not created by the enactments of Acts of Parliament, undue
influence vitiates an election. Mr. Baron Martin said in that case thus:

"There are some influences which are called due influences, and other
influences which are called undue influences, and the law has endeavoured to
punish the use of undue influences. Amongst these influences there are what
are called bribery, treating, and oppression, that is, an improper and undue
pressure put upon a man. But if pressure is put upon a man, or a bribe is
administered to him, no matter by whom, or refreshments are given to a man, no
matter by whom, for the purpose of affecting his vote, the effect is to
annihilate the man's vote, because he gives his vote upon an influence which
the law says deprives him of free action; he becomes a man incompetent to give
a vote, because he has not that freedom of will and of mind which the law
contemplates he ought to have for the purpose of voting. But that affects the
man alone, it does not affect the candidate; it has merely the effect of
extinguishing the vote, and if there was a scrutiny for the purpose of
ascertaining who had the majority of lawful votes, that man's vote ought to be
struck off the poll; but that is all. But it has been long held, before these
Acts of Parliament passed at all, that by the common law of the land, that is,
law not created by the enactments of Acts of Parliament, bribery, undue
influence, and undue pressure vitiate an election. So that if it had been
proved that there existed in this town generally, bribery to a large extent,
and that it came from unknown quarters, that no

84

one could tell where it had come from, but that people were bribed generally
and indiscriminately; or if it could be proved that there was treating in all
directions on purpose to influence voters, that houses were thrown open where
people could get drink without paying for it, - by the common law such
election would be void, because it would be carried on contrary to the
principle of the law."

in the _Salford Case_ (20) decided in 1869 Mr. Baron Martin said as follows:-

"Before an election can be vitiated by reason of general riot and violence, it
must be shown to be such as to affect the freedom of election, which is that
every person who has the franchise ought to be at liberty to go and have the
means of going to the poll and giving his vote without obstruction, and
without fear or intimidation. To set aside an election on the ground of
general riot and violence, it must be established that persons possessing the
ordinary nerve and courage of men have been prevented from going to the poll
to record their votes."

The _Stafford Case_ (21) was decided in 1869, and it had been submitted by
Counsel for the petitioner there, that sufficient had been proved to show that
the election ought to be declared void at common law on the ground of general
intimidation. In response, Blackburn, J. said that he would admit that, if it
was proved that there was so much intimidation that the result of the election
may have been affected, it was not necessary to prove that it actually was
affected and that it is a question of fact whether the intimidation had been
so great that it could fairly be said that it was not a free election, that
is, that if there had not been so much intimidation, such a number of persons
would have voted who did not vote, that the result of the election would have
been different.

In the _Nottingham Case_ (22) decided in 1869 once again it was emphasized
that "if rioting takes place to such an extent that ordinary men, having the
ordinary nerve and courage of men, are thereby prevented from recording their
votes, the election is void by the Common Law, for the Common Law provides
that an election should be free in a sense that all persons shall have an
opportunity of

85

coming to the poll and voting without fear or molestation. But for the purpose
it must be rioting to an extent certainly to deter a man of ordinary
reasonable nerve from going to the poll".

The foregoing cases contained in the O'Malley & Hardcastle series of reports
had all been decided before the Ballot Act of 1872 when the common law method
of election by show of hand prevailed and there was no voting by secret
ballot. Secrecy of voting, as being a kind of foundation upon which the
concept of a free and fair election stood, if that was the contention, was not
thought by the judges to be an essential concomitant of a free and fair
election, as these cases show.

The case of _The Borough of Dudley_ (23) decided after the Ballot Act of 1872
introduced voting by secret ballot, was one where the substantial allegation
in the petition was that there was so much riot and intimidation by mobs that
there was no free election. Mr. Justice Grove set aside the election, in the
view that he took on the evidence, that although the rioting and assaults were
not committed by mobs acting for one side only, the more formidable violence
was on the part of the mob which espoused the respondent's side and that the
result was that a large number of voters were deterred and prevented from
exercising the franchise and that the election therefore was not a free one
and the constituency had not a fair opportunity of freely exercising the
franchise. He went on to add however:

"I by no means say that if a case had been made out of the violence being
wholly or substantially on the side of the defeated candidate, and if I was
satisfied that the result of the poll was a fair expression of the opinion of
the constituency, I should have come to this conclusion, but the case, taking
it in the most favourable view for the Respondent, stops far short of this."

In the _North Durham case_ (24) once again decided after voting by secret
ballot had been introduced into the law, the allegation in the petition was
that the election was void on account of general riot and intimidation. In
declaring the election void, there being a concession

86

by the successful candidate that the evidence was adequate to establish
general intimidation, Mr. Baron Bramwell commented thus:

"I take it that the law is this; first of all, there is the statutory
intimidation, that contemplated by the statute, if one may use such an
expression, that is, an intimidation contemplated by the statute which avoids
the seat, where a candidate or his agent is guilty of it. But besides that
there is another intimidation that has been called a common law intimidation,
and it applies to a case where the intimidation is of such a character, so
general and extensive in its operation that it cannot be said that the polling
was a fair representation of the opinion of the constituency. If the
intimidation was local or partial, for instance, if in this case it had been
limited to one district.... I have no doubt that in that case it would have
been wrong to have set aside this election, because one could have seen to
demonstration that the result could not possibly have been brought about by
that intimidation, and that the result would not have been different if it had
not existed. I do not mean the result of the polling in that particular
district, but the general result of the majority for the Respondents. But
where it is of such a general character that the result may have been
affected, in my judgment, it is no part of the duty of a judge to enter into a
kind of scrutiny to see whether possibly, or probably even, or as a matter of
conclusion upon the evidence, if that intimidation had not existed the result
would have been different. What the judge has to do in that case is to say
that the burden of proof is cast upon the constituency whose conduct is
incriminated, and unless it can be shown that the gross amount of intimidation
could not possibly have affected the result of the election it ought to be
declared void. Now in questions of this sort one must look not only to the
amount of intimidation, but to the absolute majority which has been obtained.
It was the opinion of Mr. Justice Willes, and I believe it is not inconsistent
with. the opinion of Mr. Justice Keogh, as expressed in that celebrated and
most useful judgment which he gave in the Galway case, that you are to look at
the probable effect of intimidation, which consists of two things, the extent
and operation of the intimidation, and the majority which the sitting members
got...

87

Now, I think if it were otherwise and if one were told that partial
intimidation would avoid an election, although it was certain that it had not
affected the result of the election, the consequence would be that a few
mischievous persons might upset every election."

The case of The Thornbury Division of T _he Country of Gloucester_ (25) once
again decided after the Ballot Act of 1872, was one where an allegation in the
petition was inter alia of intimidation. Mr. Justice Field in delivering
judgment said as follows:

"But besides this statutory prohibition there is what is known as common law
intimidation and riot. Now there are two leading cases upon this subject, one
the _North Durham Case_ (24) and the other the _Drogheda Case_ (18) and I
propose here to adopt the language of Lord Bramwell in the former, which
confirms the view of Mr. Justice Willes, in the _Lichfield Case_ (26). as
supplying the legal test which we must apply to these facts. Now in this
constituency, out of twenty-three polling districts only three are affected by
this crime, and that out of 11333, the total number of electors, 9529 went to
the poll. The .number of voters in the three districts in question is 789, and
all but 87 voted. It is therefore difficult to come to the conclusion that any
such intimidation or violence was used as practically prevented any
considerable number of persons from voting. Again, we must consider not
whether any particular person or particularly nervous person was affected by
it. We must take the electors as an average of ordinary men who may be
disinclined to go to the poll, but who were not necessarily intimidated. A man
of ordinary courage would not necessarily be intimidated by what happened, and
it is a very strong feature in the case that, speaking generally, the violence
did not occur until after 6 o'clock in the evening, and the petitioner has not
attempted to prove that during the interval between 6 and 8 o'clock, persons
who wanted to go to the poll were prevented from doing so, or that practically
there was no polling between these hours. I say that if that had been proved
it would have gone strongly to show that this rioting had the effect of
intimidating voters ... It seems to me that the question which I have to
decide is whether all the

88

electors of the other divisions of the constituency are to be disfranchised
for what was done in the three divisions, and a fresh election held with all
its turmoil and excitement. That will have to be done if I am satisfied that
there has not been that free exercise of the franchise which everybody is
entitled to have, and that the absence of that has been caused by intimidation
and riot. But after the most careful consideration, I am unable to come to the
conclusion that this case falls within the principle of the Durham Case, and
upon this part of the case my judgment must be for the Respondent."

The _North Louth Case_ (8) was heard in 1911. It came up before a bench
consisting of Gibson, J. and Madden, J. In the course of his judgment Gibson,
J. observed that the election under consideration held in the month of
December 1910 was fought on the same register as the one in the month of
January previous, the total number of registered electors being 5761 at both
such elections: that at the January election the unsuccessful candidate in the
December election won by a majority of 99, the total polled being 4786 leaving
975 unpolled: that at the December election the poll was 4556 leaving 1205
unpolled: that the decrease in number of actual electors was 230, a figure
which might represent natural wastage on the register from lapse of time, and
that the 'successful candidate at the December election was returned by a
majority of 488. In his judgment Mr. Justice Gibson at pages 136 and 137
stated thus:-

"To upset an election for general intimidation it is necessary to show that
there was such general intimidation as might have affected the result of the
election (the _Stafford Case_ (21) the _Thornbury Case_ (27) _The Ipswich
Case_ (28) ).

Where there is such general intimidation, the onus of proving that the gross
amount of intimidation could not have affected the election is cast upon the
constituency. The _North Durham Case_ (24).

The amount of the majority is held to be important. Looking at the figures in
the various polling districts at the two elections on

89

the same register, a circumstance that has perhaps never occurred before, the
restricted character of the intimidation proved as regards area and number of
cases, the majority of 488 on the same register as in January, I find it
difficult to bring the class of 'intimidation here relied upon, which I may
term preventive intimidation, keeping voters from the poll, within the
authorities as to general intimidation at common law.

Dealing with what is to me a new field of law, I am unwilling to extend the
principle of common law intimidation by prevention beyond what the authorities
cited seem to cover ...

The petitioners' case was rested on preventive intimidation of the type dealt
with in the reported cases relied upon by the Respondent's counsel. The
difficulty in those cases was that so many of them depended on facts, and one
case on facts could not bind another, as Lord Halsbury has so emphatically
explained in London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons (29) and Lord Chief Baron
Palles in Rex v. Dolan (30) and the difficulty is increased when, as
frequently happens the facts do not appear in the report but must be inferred
from the judgments.

To avoid misconception I wish to point out that this point of numbers polled,
districts, and majority, always difficult of application, has, in my opinion,
little, if any operation when the intimidation is not preventive, to exclude
voters, but persuasive, to win votes by a process of forcible conversion
addressed to fear."

In the same case Mr. Justice Madden (at pages 172 & 173) said thus:

"Intimidation operates on the mind of the intimidated, and when this influence
pervades the electors to such an extent as to render the action of the
constituency other than free, the election held under such circumstances is
void and of no effect at common law, irrespective of any question of agency
between the authors of the intimidation and the candidate in whose interest it
has been exercised. From its very nature it is

90

incapable of the exact proof which can be adduced with regard to particular
instances of intimidation, or other undue influence. But its existence is a
conclusion to be inferred from the evidence given in the case as well of
general conduct as of specific acts, and from a consideration of the nature of
the undue influence alleged to have been brought to bear upon the electors and
of the action of the constituency; a matter in regard to which the amount of
the majority by which a seat was won and the number of electors polled,
relatively, to the entire constituency and also to other elections, are proper
to be considered".

One of the objects of the exercise of examining these old English cases has
been to ascertain the extent to which secrecy of voting was considered an
essential element of the English common law concept of a free and fair
election, and taking into account what I gather from them and also keeping in
mind the secrecy of voting provisions contained in the Constitution and in the
Presidential Elections Act, I find that I cannot read such provisions so as to
impose a prohibition upon the Court from examining any material that might be
considered relevant, as to how or in what manner voters would or might have
voted, so long as there is not involved an exercise at asking a voter how he
did in fact vote, although there too, I see nothing to prevent a voter
volunteering that information.

I have excerpted such material from the judgments in the cases reported by
O'Malley & Hardcastle from their compilation of decisions in trials of
Election Petitions, as I thought would be of use for a proper understanding of
the principles of the common law as to general intimidation and their
application to the facts of any given case. Some of them as pointed out were
cases decided at a time when voting was not by secret ballot. In some of them,
if not in a good many of them, the general intimidation complained of appears
to have been calculated either to achieve the success of one candidate or the
defeat of another, a feature which perhaps could be distinguished from the
present case.

It is perhaps well to keep in mind that in the case we are concerned with, the
intimidation was not calculated to advance the interest of the 1st respondent.
For the sake of completeness therefore

91

it may be mentioned here that there is to be found the following passage in
Rogers on Election 20th Edition Volume 2 at page 347 which gives the effect of
the authorities as to the position in England under the common law thus:

"Whatever the form taken by the violence, it would be a sufficient answer to
prove that it was practised not by persons acting in the interest of the
respondent, but against him, and in the interest of the other candidate. . ."

Although in the instant case the intimidation was not practised in the
interest of the petitioner, yet such intimidation was not practised by persons
acting in the interest of the 1st respondent either, and therefore to that
extent shares this common feature with the situation contemplated by this
passage, the implication of which is something that the Court should not be
altogether unmindful of.

It is possible now to embark upon an examination of the essential submissions
relied on by Mr. H. L. de Silva as constituting the basis of the petitioner's
case. The most important aspect of those submissions is on the question of
general intimidation in respect of which, in the context of section 91(a) of
the Presidential Elections Act is to be found the following passage (at page
270) in the order of the Court on the preliminary objections, which I have set
out in part earlier but which for ease of understanding is reproduced here
once again.

"So it seems to us that on the basis of instances or acts of general
intimidation established by evidence, the Court may draw a reasonable
inference therefrom that the majority of voters may have been prevented from
electing the candidate of their choice. In a case of general intimidation the
question that arises is - from the proved acts of intimidation of electors, is
it reasonable to suppose that the result of the election may have been
affected? This, it seems to us to be the true meaning of the words 'majority
of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred'. But, it will be open to the returned candidate to show that the
gross intimidation could not possibly have affected the result of the
election".

92

The effect of what Mr. H. L. de Silva suggested with respect to this passage
was tantamount to saying that the inappropriate use of the word "result"
there, has led to a good part of the confusion which needs clarification. He
submitted that nowhere has the Court in its order equated the expression
appearing in section 91 (a) "the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred" with the words,
"the result of the election was affected", as used in section 91(b), such that
the former expression must be taken to convey the same notion as the latter.
Indeed his contention was that the Court could not, upon a correct
understanding of the law have done so. The word "result" occurs in two places
in this passage and if I understood Mr. H. L. de Silva correctly, his
complaint was that its use the first time is misleading. Once again, if I
understood him correctly, the use of this word a second time is appropriate
and denotes that there is a burden cast on the 1st respondent, the manner in
which that burden was to be discharged being what was indicated by the way the
word "result" was used the second time. This latter part of his submission
however is something I will reserve for consideration later. The use of the
word "result" as appearing the first time in that passage was, he contended,
an "imprecise judicial paraphrase" of the true words in section 91(a). He
submitted that the word "result" as used the first time in this passage by the
Court, was intended to mean, "the effect or consequence on the voters' freedom
of choice of candidate" and that the upshot of this at this election was of
such a magnitude as to lead to the conclusion that the majority of electors
may have been prevented from electing the candidate of their choice,
regardless of whom they would have voted for, if they had had the opportunity
to do so. It will become necessary therefore at some stage, to examine whether
the Court's expression complained of, was intended to convey what Mr. H. L. de
Silva contended was the true meaning of the section or whether on the other
hand it was truly intended to convey the other meaning suggested by the
"imprecise judicial paraphrase". Mr. H. L. de Silva's position was that he was
not contending that it was no part of the petitioner's case upon the petition
to show that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. His argument rather was that the
expression did not mean the same as, "the result of the election was
affected", as these words appear in

93

section 91 (b) of The Presidential Elections Act and as interpreted by the
Court in its order on the preliminary objections. These words, in his
submission, were intended to suggest the notion that a significant number of
voters were prevented from exercising the franchise, that is to say, that a
greater number than those who voted would otherwise have voted freely but were
prevented from doing so. He contended that when the Court in its order on the
preliminary objections used words which might on their face suggest that they
mean an affectation of the result, that was a judicial paraphrase of
convenience and hence as I understood him, this inexactitude was one of the
matters in that order that require clarification. The interpretation sought to
be placed on section 91 (a) of the Presidential Elections Act on behalf of the
petitioner, Mr. H. L. de Silva said, calls for proof of the facts and
circumstances of the general intimidation and their intensity of virulence and
perversive character, and the magnitude of the effect brought about, or, in
other words the number of voters affected by being unable to vote, without the
Court having to delve into their political loyalties or choice of candidate.
The evidence while demonstrating the existence of general intimidation of that
quality and kind had the result, he claimed, of preventing about 25% of the
total of registered voters numbering around two and a half million from
exercising their franchise, that figure being six or seven times the size of
the majority which the 1st respondent secured over the petitioner. In these
circumstances he contended that there is by way of evidence in the case,
sufficient material in discharge of the burden which the section cast upon
her. Something that strikes me here is, that the mere existence of a situation
where the number of votes not cast is many times the difference between the
votes secured by the winning candidate and the runner-up, should not, of
itself, be allowed to assume an unduly important significance. It seems to me
that the larger the electorate, as for instance when the whole Island is taken
into reckoning as at a Presidential Election where therefore the total number
of registered voters would run into millions, conceivably at any election
(regarding which there is no complaint) the difference between the actual
voter turn-out and a theoretically possible 100% voter turn-out could well be
many time the difference in votes between those of the successful candidate
and of the runner-up. At the same time it must not be overlooked that the
smaller the majority of the winning candidate over

94

the runner-up at any such election, the greater the chance there is of that
number as a fraction of the shortfall in votes becoming widened.

It is now necessary to consider what implications arise from Mr. de Silva's
claim that these factors have been established. For a start there is the claim
that reasonably, 80% of the total number of registered voters (i.e. the total
of the 55% that voted and the 25% who were said to have been prevented from
voting) could have been expected to have voted at this election, had it riot
been for such general intimidation. That percentage has been arrived at on the
basis that it represents what he termed the national average of voters who
have voted during the post-independence period.

In this connection before looking at what the evidence in the case taken as a
whole suggests as to general intimidation, there are however one or two
prefatory matters that need to be mentioned. Section 91 (a) of the
Presidential Elections Act requires that it must be demonstrated that by
reason of general intimidation, the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. What does the
expression "by reason of general intimidation" mean? The meaning as I have
understood it suggests, that as a consequence of general intimidation there
was this effect, that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented
from electing the candidate whom they preferred, which to my mind connotes
once again the notion that the general intimidation must be calculated to
bring about this effect. The meaning adopted by the petitioner I find not
inconsistent with this position and in her petition she has chosen to use the
words, "In .consequence". Mr. H. L. de Silva's submissions also suggested
this, that it was the objective of this intimidation to bring about this
effect. In the case of Piyadasa v. Gunasinghe 43 N.L.R. 36 Hearne J. (at page
39) used the same word, **" calculated"** that I have used as the following
passage shows "I have mentioned in bare outline the incidents prior to
December 14 which were calculated to prevent and did, in my opinion prevent a
free and fair exercise of the franchise."

General intimidation, as opposed to statutory intimidation can consist of two
broad types. Nagalingam, J. referred to them in _Tarnolis Appuhamy v. Wilmot
Perera_ (7) in the following passage:

95

"No evidence was given of what may be termed coercive intimidation, that is to
say, intimidation having for its object the use of force or threat to compel a
voter to vote for a particular candidate, but what evidence was led was led to
show that the electorate was subjected to preventive intimidation, that is to
say, intimidation which had for its object the prevention of electors from
going to the polls lest the rival candidate gets their votes".

Nagalingam, J. refers to these two types of intimidation as being "coercive"
and "preventive" in this passage somewhat on the lines that Mr. Justice Gibson
did in the North Louth case I have already referred to. In the context of the
case before him, he has described the object of preventive intimidation to be
to deter voters from voting for the rival candidate, which suggests that such
intimidation had been practised for the benefit of his opponent. Apart from
that kind of preventive intimidation, there can perhaps be another type, which
is general intimidation calculated to prevent all voters from going to the
poll, regardless of their voting preferences. It is that type of general
intimidation that is of relevance in this case and therefore it becomes
necessary to see what the evidence suggests in this regard. Mr. H. L. de Silva
in the course of his submissions contended that there were admissions by Mr.
Choksy to the effect that there was such general intimidation as had the
effect he contended for. Irrespective of whether or not there be any such
admission, it is essentially a part of the Courts function and indeed its duty
to reach the appropriate conclusions' and draw the necessary inferences
arising from the evidence before it. In addition in a matter pertaining to an
election petition, there is the public interest element involved and the Court
cannot by reason of admissions or anything to that effect be totally relieved
of its duty in this regard. (vide for example the approach the Court adopted
in the _North Louth Case_ (8). Even if it means that any important questions
that may arise, not only as respects general intimidation but also as to
certain other aspects of the case have to be decided upon a basis that has not
been contended for by any of the parties, that is something that cannot be
helped. In saying so I also have in mind what I consider to be the somewhat
unexpected turn the case took at the end. As a statement of general
application, it is correct in any event to say that a Court is

96

called upon to arrive at a just decision in the case, and that sometimes may
have to be done regardless of what the parties may or may not contend. Indeed
a Court is fully empowered to act in such a fashion as was pointed out by Sir
John Donaldson M. R. in the case of _R v. Chief Constable of the Merseyside
Police Ex parte Calveley and others_ (31).

"In reaching this conclusion, the Court, as it was entitled to do, was
proceeding of its own motion in the sense that this was not a contention
advanced on behalf of either party".

Mr. R. K. W. Gunasekera who continued the submissions commenced by Mr. H. L.
de Silva for the petitioner, made two statements, one as his own assertion,
and the other in response to a question put by me. His assertion was that the
contention of Mr. Choksy that the situation during the 1989 general election
had undergone an improvement from the standpoint of general intimidation, as
compared with what it was at the time of the Presidential Election in December
1988, was incorrect. My question to him that resulted in the other statement
was as to what inference, in the state of the evidence before the Court, one
could draw from the increase in the percentage of those who voted in the 1989
general election, as compared with the percentage that voted at the
Presidential Election in 1988 and his reply was that there was no inference
which such evidence suggested. The effect of the two statements together, to
my mind, is to suggest that there was no change in the atmosphere of
intimidation at the different times at which these two elections were held,
but that there was nonetheless an increase in the percentage of voter turn-
out, a phenomenon which according to what Mr. Gunasekera said, the evidence
did not explain. One would not then be too far wrong in saying that if such
could be the position as to the increased percentage of voting in 1989 by
reference to 1988, similar unknown and unascertained causes could well have
also contributed in some measure to a decline in the percentage of those who
voted at the Presidential Election of 1988 as compared with the so-called
national average of 80%. I most certainly must not be understood to say here
that there is no evidence to show that general intimidation did have an effect
on the voter turn-out in 1988. What I do say is that to state a percentage

such as 80 points on the basis of a national average, and then to attribute
the whole of the claimed shortfall to general intimidation, could well be
inaccurate. The petitioner's own contention is that there was this climate of
intimidation which was prevalent before and during the Presidential Election
in 1988 and continued thereafter, even beyond the time of the general election
in 1989. What is it then that the evidence suggests? If one takes account of
some items of evidence, it could be said that there were calculated attempts
at intimidating voters in order to prevent them from voting. Examples of such
evidence were of posters displayed warning against voting at the election,
disruption of political meetings, attempts to sabotage the holding of the poll
at some polling stations, preventing the poll from being conducted at certain
polling stations etc. But apart from these items of evidence which suggest the
adoption of tactics of general intimidation calculated to prevent the holding
of the election, the remaining mass of evidence demonstrates something
somewhat different. Mr. H. L. de Silva's description of that at different
places was thus:-

"An election held amidst a massive compaign of terror, held under an all-
pervasive climate of fear".

"All these acts have been commonly attributed to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
which long before 1988 had given up any hope of coming to power through the
parliamentary process when the leader of the J.V.P. who was a candidate at the
1982 Presidential Election had only succeeded in obtaining less than 6% of the
votes polled. The violence that began with the protest against the 1987 Indo-
Sri Lanka Accord increased in intensity and continued throughout 1988. It is
beyond dispute that the J.V.P. was opposed to the holding of the Presidential
Election in 1988 not because it was opposed to any particular candidate but
because the entire objective was to bring about a revolutionary change in the
legal order and overturn the entire constitutional structure which provided
the legal machinery for the establishment of a governmental regime. The J.V.P.
opposition and attacks were directed at the very holding of the election
because the objective was to destroy the entire system of democratic
government. It was an anti-systemic movement

98

calculated to destroy any claim to legitimacy through a process of democratic
elections. Hence the carefully planned attempts to disrupt the civil
administration, paralyse the transport and communications systems, impose
unauthorised curfews, the compulsory closure of shops, business houses,
schools, hospitals and bring about a general breakdown in essential services.
In short, the object was to bring about a situation of wholesale chaos and
disorder that would have enabled a revolutionary take-over of the
administration".

"As I said before it was an anti-systemic agitation to dismantle democracy and
usher in a reign of chaos and confusion before the final push for a
revolutionary take-over of the administration. I think all of us here can
vividly recall the tense atmosphere that prevailed at the time. We remember
the anxiety, fear and apprehension which afflicted everyone and filled our
nights and days. The whole nation was in the grip of fear and traumatised by
the J.V.P. terror. A great many of those incidents have been unfolded in the
evidence and portrays in graphic detail what one English Judge in a like
context has called a 'communism of terror'. The whole nation was enveloped by
a cloud of anxiety and fear".

"It was anti-systemic i.e. violence directed to bring about the destruction of
the whole democratic structure of government and the collapse of all
government institutions. It was a movement whose first aim was to annihilate
the existing power structure and then attempt a revolutionary take-over of the
apparatus of the State by armed force."

If these passages are truly descriptive of what the evidence shows, then it is
reasonable to say that this climate of intimidation that commenced in 1987,
continued from then on till the time of the general election and beyond. I
repeat that certain specific acts brought out in the evidence do certainly
fall within the description of those calculated to prevent the holding of the
election. The evidence of these acts apart, the rest of the evidence suggests
not general intimidation calculated to achieve the specific objective of
preventing

99

the Presidential Election of 1988 from being held, but rather that the true
picture is that this election was conducted while there was present throughout
the country a climate of intimidation the object of creating which was to
instil fear into the minds of the general public, voters and non-voters alike,
so as to secure their submission and obedience to the demands and directions
of this external force. If this movement was "anti-systemic", then the
intimidation was calculated to be against the system and all components of the
system and the holding of an election being such a component was a target; but
it was not the sole target in the sense of a calculated effort to prevent the
holding of the election isolated from the system. Indeed it must be remembered
that 55% of the total number of registered voters, people of ordinary courage,
men and women, young and old, went to the polls openly and visibly and that to
my mind suggests that they were appreciative of the point made, that by and
large an atmosphere of terror and tension had been created in the country for
the larger purpose of overturning the entire established system. A statement
to the effect then that this election was held during the prevalence of such a
climate of intimidation does not necessarily mean that there was general
intimidation as was altogether calculated to prevent electors from voting or
the majority of electors from electing the candidate whom they preferred. The
conclusion that I draw then from the evidence taken as a whole is, that
although certain aspects of such intimidation had an effect on the
Presidential Election of 1988, particularly such acts as were directed
specifically to discourage voters from voting, nonetheless one cannot say with
any degree of certainty or reasonable probability that such election did not
show a voter turn-out of 80% or indeed any other ascertainable percentage, as
a consequence of general intimidation calculated to prevent the holding of
this election. When one is unable to draw a line of separation between the
continued atmosphere of intimidation and tension that prevailed in the country
during this entire period and the acts of general intimidation committed which
were calculated to prevent the holding of the Presidential Election, one is in
an uncertain area of speculation as to what percentage of loss of voter turn-
out at such election, whether 25% as claimed or any other quantifiable
percentage, could be attributed to general intimidation calculated to prevent
electors from voting or the majority of electors from electing the candidate
whom they preferred. In this regard it is

100

also possible to say that though over 50% of ordinary persons of average
courage voted, others who might well have fallen within that description
though not intimidated, could nonetheless have desisted from voting
considering it sensible to keep away from the poll, guided by a counsel of
prudence that discretion is the better part of valour, much in the same way
that they might have been inclined to do, had they decided to remain in their
homes without going about as freely as they might have done under conditions
of normalcy. The point sought to be emphasized here is that quite a number of
voters who may have refrained from voting could well have done so as an act of
prudence and not because they were intimidated and thus it cannot be said that
they were prevented from voting, but rather that they exercised a choice not
to vote. Some sense of what I have in mind can be got from the following words
used by Mr. Justice Field in the case of The Thornbury Division of the County
of Gloucesterl (27) which I have already referred to "We must take the
electors as an average of ordinary men who may be disinclined to go to the
poll, but were not necessarily intimidated". How then can one apportion any
precise percentage of the drop in voter turn-out in December 1988 to general
intimidation as that expression is used in a context relevant to an election,
whether such percentage be 25 points or any other, as a matter of reasonable
conclusion from the evidence in the case, without running the risk of
committing a serious error? For myself, I find that I am unable to draw any
reasonable conclusion, which the evidence would warrant as to what fraction of
the percentage that did not vote at the Presidential Election, as compared to
the percentage that might ordinarily have been expected in a normal situation
to have voted, was attributable to the practice of general intimidation
calculated to prevent voters from voting, which is what matters in the case.

The next question that requires consideration is as to the majority the 1st
respondent secured over the petitioner, which it was claimed was a fraction of
the order of 1/6th or 1/7th of the number of additional votes that would have
come in, if 80% of the registered voters had voted. The following figures were
submitted in support of the petitioner's position that if this 80% did vote
she could have overtaken the 1st respondent by one vote and achieved victory
if she had obtained 279339 out of the additional votes numbering 2314371.

The number 279339 can be arrived at by deducting the total number of votes the
petitioner obtained from those that the 1st respondent did, but a close look
will show that the calculation relied on is itself made in such a way as to
arithmetically achieve this result. At first glance, these figures have no
doubt the appearance of plausibility, but I will endeavour to demonstrate the
erroneous basis upon which this result is reached. Section 56(2) of the
Presidential Elections Act directs The Commissioner of Elections, if he finds
that any particular candidate has received more than one half of the total
number of valid votes cast, to forthwith declare such candidate elected. If
however no candidate receives more than one half of the total valid

102

votes cast, then there is a procedure laid down which involves the counting of
preference votes. To achieve an 80% voter turn-out, an additional 2314371
votes would have had to be cast. Upon the figures presented for the
petitioner, it was claimed that if 80% of all registered voters did vote, the
petitioner would have received one vote in excess of one half of the total
number of votes cast and achieved victory, had she obtained an extra 1460438
votes in addition to those she actually received at the election numbering
2289860\. Giving her that number of 1460438 votes out of the additional
2314371 votes cast, would leave a balance of 853933 votes. Now what happens to
this remaining number of 853933 votes? They cannot be disregarded and must
enter into the calculation. Let me assume that the entirety of that number is
allotted to the 1st respondent. Then his total moves up to 3423132 which is a
sum of that number plus 2569199, being the number of votes he actually
received. It will be noted that this number 3423132 is less (by a figure of
327166) than the number 3750298 which is the total shown as necessary for the
petitioner to obtain one vote in excess of one half of the total of the votes
cast and achieve victory. Why is that so? It is so, because out of the
additional 2314371 votes taken into reckoning in this exercise, to achieve her
victory a percentage which works out to approximately 63.10 has been allotted
to the petitioner leaving a balance of only 36.90% available to be allotted to
the 1st respondent, assuming that is, that the whole of it were to be allotted
to him. If on the other hand on the figures presented, the 1st respondent was
to achieve victory having received one half of the total of the votes polled
plus one out of the total number of 80% votes polled, a calculation on a like
basis will demonstrate that he would have to be allotted approximately 51.03%
of the extra 2314371 votes polled with 48.97% available to be allotted to the
petitioner. The result of this exercise done in the manner claimed then, is to
show that with an 80% voter turn-out, to ensure the petitioner's success she
would have had to obtain 63.10% out of the additional votes, being a
percentage much in excess of the 44.95% that she actually received at the
election; while the 1st respondent's share of the additional votes would be
reduced to 39.90% being much less than the 50.43% he actually received at the
election. Similarly with a 80% voter turn-out, to achieve victory the 1st
respondent would have had to obtain 51.03% of the additional votes cast, being
an increase marginally

103

over the 50.43% he actually received at the election, with 48.97% available to
the petitioner out of the excess votes cast which once again is in excess of
the 44.95% that she actually received at the election. Therefore the picture
that emerges on an 80% voter turn-out calculated on the basis suggested is
that the petitioner, whether successful or unsuccessful, would have obtained a
greater percentage of the extra votes cast than she actually received at the
election; whereas in the case of the 1st respondent if he was successful he
would have obtained a percentage of the extra votes cast, marginally above the
percentage he actually received at the election, and if he was unsuccessful a
percentage of the extra votes cast, much lower than that which he received at
the election.

To complete the picture, I will now take a situation where hundred percent of
the registered voters are considered to have voted and deal with that
situation in the manner in which the petitioner dealt with an 80% voter turn-
out; that is in such a way as to maintain the arithmetical majority of 279339
which the 1st respondent actually secured over the petitioner at the election.
To achieve such hundred percent voter turn-out there should have been an
additional 4189519 votes. Half the total number of votes cast then would have
been really half the total number of registered voters and would amount to
4687871. The petitioner having received 2289860 votes, the balance required to
make up one half of the total number of votes cast would have been 2398011
votes with an additional one vote necessary to achieve victory bringing the
number up to 2398012. That would represent a 57.23% of the extra votes being
allocated to her with the balance 42.77% available to the 1st respondent. If
on the other hand the 1st respondent was to have achieved victory, in addition
to the 2569199 votes he received, he would have had to obtain an additional
2118672 out of the extra votes to reach the level of one half of the votes
cast with one vote added to achieve victory, that number then becoming
2118673. That would be 50.57% out of the extra votes with 49.43% available to
the petitioner.

This exercise demonstrates the anomalies that arise when hypothetical figures
are taken as constituting total voter turn-out percentages and it is sought to
maintain the figure of 279339 being the majority the 1st respondent in fact
received over the petitioner at the election. In doing so one sees that
varying hypothetical

104

percentages of the extra votes cast have to be assigned to the parties,
percentages completely different from those actually polled at the election
with no basis, factual or arithmetical to justify doing so.

A more realistic method that commends itself to me is to base a possible
calculation on the actual votes cast. The valid votes polled at the election
were thus:

_\---------------------_

|

5094778  
  
 Now the effect of what was contended for the petitioner is that to equal the
1st respondent's total of 2569199, all that was necessary was to obtain 279339
extra votes and that one more vote beyond that number would give her a
majority as well as success at the election. Arithmetically it would be
correct to say that she would have received such majority, assuming that the
1st respondent's number of votes remained static. By receiving this number of
votes the petitioner would have overtaken the 1st respondent's total by one
vote. But adding 279340 votes to the votes actually polled by the petitioner
would mean that the total number of votes cast in the election would have
increased by that number because such number could not have been taken out of
the votes cast for either of the other candidates. When the total votes cast
gets increased by 279340 adding up to the number 5374118, one half of that
number becomes 2687059 and the petitioner's total would have been what she
received, namely 2289860 plus the 279340 added for the purpose of this
exercise, totalling to 2569220. This figure falls short of the level of one
half of the total votes cast required and upon that total, she could not have
been declared the winning candidate under section 56(2) of the Presidential
Elections Act. Nor for that matter, would the 1st respondent have received a
figure in excess of one half of the total thus made up, and this would have
resulted in the need to count the preference votes in order to ascertain who
the winning candidate would have been. Arithmetically it will then be seen
that in order to

105

reach the level of one half of the total votes cast, the petitioner would have
had to receive in addition to the number she actually polled, an extra 515058
votes and to exceed that number, another one vote. That too would be on the
basis that neither of the other candidates received a single extra vote apart
from what they actually polled. To maintain that one vote lead and at the same
time to maintain the level of having reached one half of the total of the
votes cast, for each one vote either of the other candidates received, the
petitioner herself would have had to receive an additional countervailing
vote. The manner in which the number 515058 was reached is thus. The votes
received by the 1st respondent numbering 2569199 and Mr. Oswin Abeygunasekera
numbering 235719 total to 2804918. The petitioner having received 2289860
could have equalled that total by obtaining 515058 extra votes and with a
single vote added to that number it will be seen that while achieving victory
she would have also reached the level of having secured one half of the total
votes cast.

As I see it therefore, it is not accurate for the petitioner to contend in the
context of the Presidential Elections Act that the majority which she had to
overcome was 279339 votes, which therefore constituted only a 1/6th or 117th
of the total votes that would have been polled had 80% of the voters in fact
voted at the election, and that in consequence the majority of electors may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred in quite
the manner as was contended for her.

Apart from this there is another aspect which cannot be disregarded. One must
take care to be reminded of the fact that this proposition as contended for
the petitioner is based upon the actual figures that became available at the
conclusion of the election. The proposition is that the 1st respondent's
majority over the petitioner's total of votes was only 1/6th or 1/7th of the
25% shortfall in the votes. It is with respect to such a situation that it was
contended for the petitioner, that if she secured a further 279339 votes she
could have erased the 1st respondent's majority over her. But the question is,
if the extra 25% did vote, who is to know what the distribution pattern of
these votes between the three candidates would have been, so as to enable one
to say, as claimed, that if the petitioner obtained 279339 votes in addition
to those she actually received, she would

106

have overtaken the 1st respondent's majority and at the same time received one
half of the total number of votes cast. The system of preference votes could
also, in certain circumstances, be imagined to have caused yet another
complication, if it had become necessary to take such preference votes into
account by reason of an increased voter turn-out, as a consequence of no
candidate having received over one half of the total votes polled. In that
situation if the candidate who received the lowest number of votes had to be
eliminated, his votes would then have had to be distributed among the other
candidates according to the next preference indicated by his voters. In what
proportion they would have been distributed would be an unknown factor.
Without knowing that, one would once again not be in a position to say, what
the difference would have been in the number of votes between those secured by
the winning candidate and by the runner-up, after those votes were taken into
reckoning. In a situation therefore where 80% of the voters might have been
expected to vote, how the extra 25% might in fact have voted not being known,
one cannot say whether or not the preference votes of those who voted for the
third candidate would have had to be counted and then one cannot say except as
a matter of guesswork what the difference in votes would have been between
those of the winning candidate and the runner-up.

The essence of Mr. H. L. de Silva's contention with respect to the order on
the preliminary objections was, that in interpreting the meaning of the
phrase, "the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred", the Court, as I earlier said, used the word
"result", not in the sense of a numerical count of votes, but in the sense of
a consequence or effect on the electors' choice of candidate. This, he said,
was explained in the very next sentence the Court used when it said, "But it
will be open to the returned candidate to show the gross intimidation could
not possibly have affected the result of the election." His submission
therefore was, that if the number of voters who had been prevented from voting
by reason of the gross intimidation had been six or seven times as great as
the majority the declared candidate secured over the next, then there is
demonstrated that there had been such a consequence or effect on the electors'
choice of candidate, as would enable one to say that the majority of voters
may have been

107

prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. His argument
therefore was, that in order to dispel the possibility so suggested that the
majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred, it became incumbent upon the returned candidate to show that
the shortfall in the votes due to the gross intimidation was so small as to be
less than the majority of the returned candidate, by which process the
returned candidate would then have demonstrated that the gross intimidation
could not possibly have affected the result of the election. There are certain
matters that need to be considered in this regard. There is first Mr. H. L. de
Silva's contention as to the degree of proof required, to discharge the burden
that lies upon the petitioner when invoking the provisions of section 91(a) of
the Presidential Elections Act to have the election declared void. The section
reads to be understood that, even if it may not be proved that the majority
were in fact so prevented, it would be sufficient to, prove that the majority
may have been so prevented. Mr. H. L. de Silva argued that the use of the word
"may" in the section indicates that what was required was to show that there
was that "possibility" and that such a burden therefore would be discharged
upon a lower standard of proof than suggested by the word "probability". The
word "may" as used in the section, he submitted, was equivalent in meaning to
the use of the word "possible," used as the antonym of the word "impossible".
The line of argument was that in a situation where a particular thing is
"possible", equally that same thing could be, "not possible" and that these
two situations could co-exist without being in conflict with each other, so
that to exclude a thing being "possible", it was necessary to prove that such
thing was "impossible". Counsel argued that if the evidence indicated that the
winning candidate's majority was 1/6th or 1/7th of the number that constituted
25% of the total of registered voters and that they were so prevented from
voting, there was an "inference" or "presumption" that arose, that the
majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred. If that is the situation contemplated by the word, "may", as
meaning, "possible", the question that occurs to me is whether there could not
be the same kind of possibility as a measure of the degree of proof required,
in a situation where the majority secured by the winning candidate, instead of
being 1/6th or 1/7th, is just short of the shortfall in votes. To displace
such inference

108

 or presumption, there was, he submitted, a burden cast on the 1st respondent
according to the Court's order on the preliminary objections, to show that the
majority of electors were, in fact, not prevented from electing the candidate
whom they preferred, as would be the case in a situation where the number of
those who were prevented from voting was less than the winning candidate's
majority. What he submitted amounts to this, that the petitioner had
discharged the burden which lay upon her by virtue of such inference or
presumption, and that consequently the burden had shifted to the 1st
respondent to show that the majority of electors were not prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. If it be correct that such a
burden came to be cast upon the 1 st respondent, what in reality is the effect
of his so demonstrating in that manner that the majority of electors had not
been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. Then a
numerical test is used to rebut a hypothetical possibility. The moment such a
thing is done is there not implicit in the exercise, an endeavour at
discovering whether another candidate should have achieved victory instead of
the returned candidate? The effect of doing that is, as I see it, that by an
exercise involving a numerical reckoning of votes, it is sought to establish
that the declared candidate's success remains unaffected. To show that in that
way, is to show that the result of the election was not affected, using that
expression in a sense analogous to that in which its words are used in section
91 (b) of the Presidential Elections Act. Then, one is in the curious position
of saying that the 1st respondent is called upon to demonstrate numerically
that the result of the election was not affected, to meet a case upon which
the petitioner herself is not called upon to demonstrate numerically that the
result of the election was affected.

Something else needs to be said about the contention of learned Counsel, that
it is sufficient to show the existence of a mere possibility that the majority
of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred. The section also deals with a situation of proof, to the
satisfaction of the Court, that the majority of electors were in fact
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. This, as Mr. H. L.
de Silva contended, is a degree of proof which demonstrates a measure of
certainty. If then that be so, the degrees of proof covered by the section
would span the whole

109

range, starting from a level of certainty at one end and extending to a level
of a mere possibility or anything other than impossibility at the other, a
situation which it does not seem at all likely that the legislature could be
thought to have intended as one reads and understands the section.

Much reliance was placed for the petitioner on the judgment of the Court of
Common Pleas in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons (10). It was contended that,
not merely does the judgment set out, correctly and fully, the common law
concept of a free and fair election, but also that it was the inspiration that
guided, both in language and in concept, the entry into our law of the very
first section in terms similar to section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections
Act. That case arose out of an allegation that there was non-compliance with
the rules and forms provided for the holding of elections. The judgment of the
Court (consisting of Brett, Archibald and Denmen JJ) read by Coleridge, C.J.
contains (at pages 743 and 744) the following passages:

"The questions raised for decision seem to be. First, what is the true
statement of the rule under which an election may be avoided by the common law
of Parliament? secondly, is the present case brought within the rule? ...

As to the first, we are of opinion that the true statement, is that an
election is to be declared void by the common law applicable to parliamentary
elections, if it is so conducted that the tribunal which is asked to avoid it
is satisfied as a matter of fact, either that there was no real **electing**
at all, or that the election was not really conducted under the subsisting
election laws. As to the first, the tribunal should be so satisfied, i.e. that
there was no real electing by the constituency at all, if it were proved to
its satisfaction that the constituency had not in fact had a fair and free
opportunity of electing the candidate which the majority might prefer. This
would certainly be so, if a majority of the electors were proved to have been
prevented from recording their votes effectively according to their own

110

preference, by general corruption or general intimidation, or 'by being
prevented from voting by want of the necessary machinery for so voting, as, by
polling stations being demolished, or not opened, or by other of the means of
voting according to law not being supplied or supplied with such errors as to
render the voting by means of them void, or by fraudulent counting of votes or
false declaration of numbers by a returning officer, or by such other acts or
mishaps. And we think the same result should follow if by reason of any such
or similar mishaps, the tribunal, without being able to say that a majority
had been prevented, should be satisfied that there was reasonable ground to
believe that a majority of the electors may have been prevented from electing
the candidate they preferred. But, if the tribunal should only be satisfied
that certain of such mishaps had occurred but should not be satisfied either
that a majority had been, or that there was reasonable ground to believe that
a majority might have been, prevented from electing the candidate they
preferred, then we think that the existence of such mishaps would not enable
the tribunal to declare an election void by the common law of Parliament. This
we think, is the result of comparing the judgments of Grove, J., at _Hackney_
(13) and _Dudley_ (32) with the judgment of Martin, B., of _Salford_ (20) and
of Mellor, J., at _Bolton_ (33) all of which judgments are in accordance with,
but express more accurately, the grounds of the decisions in parliament in the
older cases of Norfolk (34), _Heyw Co_. _555.(n)_ (35), _Morepeth_ (36),
_Pontefract_ (37), _Coventry_ (38), _New Ross_ (39), & _Drogheda_ (40) & the
_Drogheda case_ (18) all of which are mentioned in Rogers on Elections, 10th
ed, 365 et seq.

As to the second, i.e. that the election was not really conducted under the
subsisting election laws at all, we think, though there was an election in the
sense of there having been a selection by the will of the constituency, that
the question must in like manner be, whether the departure from the prescribed
method of election is so great that the tribunal is satisfied, as a matter of
fact, that the election was not an election under the

111

existing law. It is not enough to say that great mistakes were made in
carrying out the election under those laws: it is necessary to be able to say
that, either wilfully or erroneously the election was not carried out under
those laws, but under some other method."

One sees that the Court of Common Pleas considered that a tribunal examining
the question as to whether an election should be declared void by the common
law, is called upon to be satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe
that the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the
candidate they preferred, in a situation where it is not proved that such
majority of electors were in fact prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred. Now what do the words **" reasonable ground to believe", **as
used by the judges in that case mean? Do they or do they not have the same
meaning as that which Mr. H. L. de Silva contended for, with respect to
section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act. His response, in answer to a
query from the Court as to this was, that the probative facts or the
evidentiary facts have to be established upon a balance of probability, but
that the factum to be proved is still in regard to the possibility of an event
or an occurrence and not as to the probability of its occurrence. I must
confess that I did not quite comprehend the intended meaning of this
submission. Assuming that he meant by this that it had to be established upon
a balance of probability, that there was a degree of general intimidation as
resulted in a shortfall in voter turn-out of 25% and that there was also a
probability that the majority secured by the winning candidate was as low as
1/6th or 1/7 th of that shortfall, is it that there arises a possibility of an
event or occurrence and if so, is that event or occurrence the prevention of
the majority of electors from electing the candidate whom they preferred? That
is the only factum to be proved that I can see upon this contention, that the
majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred, a factum to be proved as a mere possibility. If that be the
factum to be proved as a mere possibility, that the majority of electors may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, then the
factum to be proved according to the judgment in Woodward v. Sarsons is also
that the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, but there, as set out by the Judges, as a
reasonable ground of belief, which is certainly not to say as a

112

matter of mere possibility. If therefore the judgment in Woodward v. Sarsons
as to the common law is embodied in section 91 (a) of the Presidential
Elections Act, Mr. H. L. de Silva's submission is one I find that I cannot
assent to. I rather consider that the correct formulation is that which the
judges in Woodward v. Sarsons adopted, upon which it would not suffice to say
that the petitioner could discharge her burden by pointing to a mere
possibility (as opposed to an impossibility) that the majority of electors may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, but that
she has indeed to satisfy the Court as a reasonable ground of belief that the
majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred, which in my understanding means the same thing as saying,
furnishing proof as a matter not even of mere probability, but indeed of
reasonable probability.

It now becomes necessary to say that there was a burden cast upon the
petitioner to show that the majority of electors may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred, whichever meaning that expression
has, which is to show that there is reasonable ground to believe that such
majority were so prevented, and that renders it necessary to look at the
provisions of the Evidence Ordinance relating to the burden of proof in this
case. As Mr. Choksy pointed out, section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections
Act requires that it must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court, that by
reason of general intimidation the majority of electors were in fact
prevented, or that the majority of electors may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. As emphasized by Mr. Choksy, in
terms of section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance, a fact is said to be proved,
when after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to
exist, or, considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought in the
circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it
exists. If that definition of proof is applied to the terms of section 91(a)
of the Presidential Elections Act, when an election is sought to be avoided on
the basis of general intimidation, the position would be thus, whichever
meaning one takes to be the true meaning of the expression, "the majority of
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred".

113

1\. On the basis that the majority of electors were in fact prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred (a) the Court must believe as a
matter of actual existence that the majority of electors were prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred, or, (b) the Court must consider
that under the circumstances of the case, a prudent man ought to act on the
supposition that the majority of electors were prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred.

2\. On the basis that the majority of electors may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred, (a) the Court must believe as a
matter of actual existence that the majority of electors may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred or, (b) the Court
must consider that under the circumstances of the case, a prudent man ought to
act on the supposition that the majority of electors may have been prevented
from electing the candidate whom they preferred.

The next point to note, and one of importance to the result of this case is as
to the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance on the question of burden of
proof. They do have the effect of casting the burden of proof in the case upon
the petitioner to establish all the necessary ingredients which would entitle
her to the relief she demands. Sections 101, 102, and 103 may usefully be
reproduced here.

Section 101. "Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right
or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove
that those facts exist.

When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the
burden of proof lies on that person."

Section 102. " The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person
who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side."

Section 103. "The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that
person who wishes the Court to believe in its existence,

114

 unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any
particular person."

The burden then lay on the petitioner to show, not as a matter of mere
probability but as a matter of reasonable probability, that the majority of
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred, by reason of general intimidation. It is my belief that the order
of the Court which Mr. H. L. de Silva said was to cast a burden on the 1st
respondent, really did intend to say that the petitioner had to furnish the
requisite proof as to this as a reasonable ground of belief, but that it was
open to the 1st respondent to show upon a balance of probability, that a view
of the whole of the evidence was one more favourable to him.

Upon the hypothesis advanced by learned Counsel for the petitioner as to the
meaning to be gathered from the expression, " the majority of electors may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred", which he
submitted found favour with the Court as shown by its order on the preliminary
objections, I have examined the ingredients he referred to as necessary to be
proved by the petitioner. Upon such hypothesis and on her own contention as to
what she had to establish, I have to conclude as a matter of reasonable
probability or reasonable ground of belief, that the petitioner has failed to
establish, the following ingredients which are, that a particular percentage
of electors refrained from voting by reason of general intimidation calculated
to prevent them from doing so, that the number of additional votes sufficient
to entitle her to success was the number she relied upon which therefore was a
fraction of the order of 1/6th or 1/7th of the shortfall, and that there was
thus demonstrated that the majority of electors may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred in the sense contended on her
behalf. The reasons for saying this I have already explained with respect to
each ingredient separately and thus I cannot accept that the combined effect
of the material relied on to support each component was to bring about the
consequence contended for the petitioner. The conclusion then must be, that
upon the formulation adopted by learned Counsel for the petitioner, her case
presented on the basis of general intimidation must fail.

115

That should perhaps ordinarily have sufficed to dispose of the matter, that
being on the basis of the case presented for the petitioner, but there yet
remains not ascertained, the true meaning of the expression, "the majority of
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred". I will therefore proceed to address my mind to that.

Usefully, in approaching the questions then involved, I would start with the
formulation adopted by the Court of Common Pleas in the case of Woodward v.
Sarsons From the passages of the judgment which I have already reproduced, the
following propositions as respects general intimidation can be deduced.

1\. An election is to be declared void by the common law, if it was so
conducted that the tribunal is satisfied as a matter of fact, that there was
no real electing by the constituency at all.

2\. The tribunal should be satisfied that there was no real electing by the
constituency at all, if it were proved that such constituency had not, in
fact, had a fair and free opportunity of electing the candidate which the
majority of the electors might prefer.

3\. The constituency would not in fact have had a fair and free opportunity of
electing the candidate which the majority of the electors might prefer if a
majority of the electors were proved to have been prevented by general
intimidation from recording their votes effectively according to their own
preference.

4\. The same result should follow (that is that the election should be
declared void), if the tribunal, without being able to say that a majority had
been prevented, should be satisfied that there was reasonable ground to
believe that a majority of the electors may have been prevented by general
intimidation from electing the candidate they preferred.

5\. Even if the tribunal should be satisfied that some general intimidation
had taken place, but nevertheless should not be satisfied that a majority of
the electors had been prevented from electing the candidate they preferred,
the tribunal would not be entitled to declare

116

the election void by the common law, by reason only of the existence of such
general intimidation.

6\. Even if the tribunal should be satisfied that some general intimidation
had taken place, but nevertheless should not be satisfied that there was
reasonable ground to believe that a majority of the electors had been
prevented from electing the candidate they preferred, the tribunal would not
be entitled to declare the election void by the common law, by reason only of
the existence of such general intimidation.

In order to ensure accuracy, I have endeavoured to extract these propositions
from the judgment with care. If I am to rearrange the ideas expressed in the
propositions numbered 1, 2 and 3 in the reverse order so as to see how they
would read, this is the result. If the majority of electors were proved to
have been prevented by general intimidation from recording their votes
effectively according to their own preference, (which is to say they were
prevented from voting as they wished) the constituency would not have had a
fair and free opportunity of electing the candidate whom they preferred. If
the constituency did not have a fair and free opportunity of electing the
candidate whom they preferred, there would be no real electing by the
constituency at all. If there was no real electing by the constituency at all,
the election is to be declared void. If one examines the proposition numbered
3 alone, it will be seen that it appears to point to a situation as to when it
could be said that the majority of the electors have not had a fair and free
opportunity of electing the candidate whom they preferred. That is to be found
in the words, "a majority of the electors . . . were prevented from recording
their votes effectively according to their own preference". If the majority of
electors were prevented from voting as they wished, there could then be no
doubt that the election must be declared void. Let me now see what the
situation is, when it cannot be said that the majority of electors were
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, but it is possible
to say there are reasonable grounds to believe that the majority of electors
may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. In
terms of the proposition numbered 4 above, then too the election must be
declared void. If however the majority of the electors were not

117

prevented from recording their votes effectively according to their own
preference, what follows? It is perhaps on the basis that it could then be
said that the constituency was not deprived of and therefore did have a fair
and free opportunity of electing the candidate which the majority of the
electors might prefer that a position appears to have been taken for the
respondents at an early stage in the case, that the charges based upon section
91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act must fail, because in the event, the
majority of the electors (over 50% of the registered voters) had the
opportunity and did in fact vote. I however mention this only in passing, but
make no point of it.

Since the occasion lends itself to such a step, I would refer here to the
aspect of the petitioner's case as pleaded in her petition in paragraph 6C
based upon the provisions of section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act
as against the 2nd respondent, on the ground of non-compliance with the
provisions of the Act relating to the conducting of the election in accordance
with the principles contained in such provisions. The case of Woodward v.
Sarsons is important in this regard as well, and the several examples of
voters being prevented from voting by want of the machinery necessary for so
voting as shown in the quotation reproduced, are also characterised as
instances demonstrating that there was no real electing by the constituency at
all. A set of like propositions as respects that aspect is once again
extracted from the judgment thus:

1\. An election is to be declared void by the common law, if it was so
conducted that the tribunal is satisfied as a matter of fact, that there was
no real electing by the constituency at all.

2\. The tribunal should be satisfied that there was no real electing by the
constituency at all, if it were proved that such constituency had not, in
fact, had a fair and free opportunity of electing the candidate which the
majority of the electors might prefer.

3\. The constituency would not in fact have had a fair and free opportunity of
electing the candidate which the majority of the electors might prefer if a
majority of the electors were proved to have

118

been prevented by want of the machinery necessary for so voting, from
recording their votes effectively according to their own preference.

4\. The same result should follow (That is that the election should be
declared void), if the tribunal, without being able to say that a majority had
been prevented, should be satisfied that there was reasonable ground to
believe that a majority of the electors may have been prevented by want of the
machinery necessary for voting, from electing the candidate they preferred.

5\. Even if the tribunal should be satisfied that there was some breakdown of
the machinery necessary for voting, but nevertheless should not be satisfied
that a majority of the electors had been prevented from electing the candidate
they preferred, the tribunal would not be entitled to declare the election
void by the common law, by reason only of the existence of those instances of
breakdown of the machinery necessary for voting.

6\. Even if the tribunal should be satisfied that there was some breakdown of
the machinery necessary for voting, but nevertheless should not be satisfied
that there was reasonable ground to believe that a majority of the electors
had been prevented from electing the candidate they preferred, the tribunal
would not be entitled to declare the election void by the common law, by
reason only of the existence of those instances of breakdown of the machinery
necessary for voting.

Thus, I think it can be said that, as the judgment in Woodward v. Sarsons
shows, the English common law concept of a free and fair election has
relevance not only when considering the element of general intimidation, but
also in considering the element of failure to conduct an election, with the
necessary machinery provided for voters to vote, in either case, so as to
prevent the majority of electors from electing the candidate whom they
preferred.

If that be a true statement of the common law relating to the concept of a
free and fair election as it was understood in England, let me now examine our
statutory provision vis-a-vis the judgment

119

of the Court of Common Pleas in Woodward v. Sarsons. It must be kept in mind
that the relevant section, namely, section 91 (a) of the Presidential
Elections Act, is a reproduction of earlier legislation in similar terms, the
earliest to be found, if I understood Mr. H. L. de Silva correctly, in the
1931 State Council Elections Order-in-Council.

Putting together the relevant parts of the main section 91 and of section
91(a), the provision may be made to read thus:

The election . . . shall be declared to be void ... on ... the following
ground(s) which may be proved . . . , namely, that by reason of general
intimidation ... the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred.

A rearrangement of these clauses to get out the sense more clearly would, as I
see it, read:

The election shall be declared to be void on the following ground(s) which may
be proved, namely, that the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, by reason of
general intimidation.

When this section is rendered in this form it helps to identify a possible
misconception that can occur, of much significance in the case. It is seen at
once that the ground of avoidance is that the majority of electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. One can
all too easily fall into the error of thinking that a ground of avoidance
under the section is general intimidation. The ground of avoidance under
section 91(a) then is really the effect, which is that the majority of
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred and not the cause, which may be general intimidation.

The Court of Common Pleas considered in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons that
the concept of a free and fair election (or an election at which there was a
real electing) implies one at which the majority of electors had the
opportunity of electing the candidate whom they preferred. If they therefore,
that is such majority, did not have that opportunity, then there was no free
and fair election or no real

120

electing, to state the other side of the proposition, the consequence then
being that the election must be declared void.

What then is the true meaning of the language used in section 91(a) which is
said to have derived its inspiration from the judgment in this case? The
answer to that is made simpler I think by the way I have rendered the section.
The election shall be declared void when a certain eventuality or situation
exists. What is that eventuality or situation? It clearly is that the majority
of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred, as the language used reads. Prevented how, or in what way?
Prevented by reason of general intimidation or failure to comply with the
elections law, as the case may be, that being therefore the agency by which
such prevention was brought about. The identical position arises from the
judgment in the case of Woodward v Sarsons, as the propositions I have
extracted show.

Such is the way I think the sense of the section must be got, because any true
reading of it must give effect to all its words and clauses as may not be the
case if the section is read to understand as if the ground of avoidance is
general intimidation.

Something that strikes me as being supportive of the assertion I make, that
what is vitally important in the section are the words suggesting the need to
establish that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred is this. Reading the section
(erroneously) as if the ground of avoidance is failure of the electoral
machinery, when that "circumstance" is relied on, there is no criterion upon
which the election could be avoided.

Summarising what I say in this regard, in terms of section 91(a) of the
Presidential Elections Act, in order to avoid an election it must be shown
that it was not a free and fair one. It is proved not to be a free and fair
election, when it is proved that the majority of the electors were or may have
been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred (see here for
comparison the propositions extracted from the judgment in Woodward v.
Sarsons). That which prevents an election from being a free and fair one may
be, so far as is relevant to

121

this case, either the existence of general intimidation or the failure to
comply with the elections law. What may be thought of as the cause which could
be the presence of general bribery, general treating, general intimidation,
misconduct or other circumstance whether similar to these or not, must be
demonstrated to be present and shown to bring about the stated effect, which
is that the majority of voters were or may have been prevented from electing
the candidate whom they preferred. Then only can the desired consequence be
achieved, which is to have the election avoided. The cause cannot achieve the
consequence without the effect being shown. It is therefore, in my view, vital
to the success of the petitioner's case as based upon section 91(a) of the
Presidential Elections Act to prove as the primary requisite, that the
majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred. If it cannot be proved that the majority of the
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred, then the very ground relied upon, the essential factum probandum,
is not proved and it cannot then be said that there was no free and fair
election, whether the basis be general intimidation or non-compliance with the
elections law or any of the other factors referred to in the section, and the
election therefore cannot be avoided. The concept of a free and fair election
is not one to be found by reference to the words "general intimidation", but
by reference to the provision, "that the majority of electors were or may have
been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred"

I will now attempt an analytical approach to the question as to what the words
of this expression mean. The section contemplates two situations. The first is
one where the majority of electors were (in fact) prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, a situation of the highest importance in my
view to the ascertainment of the true meaning of this expression. This
position as requiring an element of certainty by way of proof is reflected in
the propositions numbered 1 to 3 relating to general intimidation which I have
extracted from the judgment in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons. The
legislature when dealing with that situation, spells out a test in section
91(a) and, independent of any question whether what is implicit in that test
is capable of proof or not, such test as a matter of clear language is this.
Were the majority of electors prevented from

122

electing the candidate whom they preferred? If the answer to that is in the
affirmative, the next question that arises from it is whether it was general
intimidation that brought about that effect, the two questions having to be
looked at in that order. Let me for the moment view this expression in the
background of the present case. If, even in the absence of the general
intimidation (or for that matter a combination of the factors of general
intimidation and a breakdown of the machinery of voting), it was the 1st
respondent who would yet have been the successful candidate, then it could not
be said that the majority of electors were prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, inasmuch as, with or without such general
intimidation, the 1st respondent would have been the preferred candidate of
the majority of electors. Logically then, to be able to say that the majority
of electors were prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred,
one must be in a position to say that it was someone other than the 1st
respondent who would have been the successful candidate whose election by the
majority of electors was prevented by general intimidation, the vitiating
factor, being the expression used by Mr. H. L. de Silva. Viewed from another
angle, the majority of electors at this election were not prevented from
voting or exercising their franchise, as over 50% did vote. That majority that
did vote, were once again not prevented from electing the candidate they
preferred. The question then is as to the minority who may have been prevented
from voting or exercising the franchise. What would have been the position,
had such minority been able to contribute their votes to the total polled? If
their contribution was not to change the result as to who would have won the
election, as a matter of legal consequence, the election must be sustained. If
on the other hand their contribution was to change the result of the election,
as a matter of legal consequence, the election must be avoided. Then, whether
the election must be avoided or not, depends on whether there would have been
a change in the successful candidate, had the minority of electors who were
prevented from voting in fact voted, which then implies a change in the
result, meaning that the result of the election was affected.

As I have pointed out, to be able to say that the majority of electors were
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, one must be in a
position to say, that it was someone other than the 1st respondent who would
have been the successful candidate

123

whose election by the majority of electors was prevented by the vitiating
factor. It does mean then, that the expression was calculated to deal with a
situation showing that someone else other than the declared candidate would
have succeeded when the expression "the majority of electors were (in fact)
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred". If that is so with
respect to a situation of certainty, that is, where the majority were in fact
prevented, a situation contemplated by the words "the majority of electors
were prevented from electing the candidate whom they prefer", what is the
position when using the expression "the majority of electors may have been
prevented"? One must necessarily attribute the same meaning to the words,
"majority of electors . . . prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred", whether the gap I have left in the sentence is to be filled by the
word "were" on the one hand or by the words "may have been", on the other;
else - there is something very wrong in the way the expression has been
structured, and I, for myself, do not see anything wrong in that regard. It
deals with, as I see, a situation that had been contemplated by the judgment
in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons and shown by me as proposition numbered 4
above, in those relating to general intimidation, where the Court is faced
with a situation contemplated by the words in the judgment "the tribunal
without being able to say that a majority had been prevented should be
satisfied that there was reasonable ground to believe that a majority of
electors may have been prevented". When encountering such a situation, the
Court of Common Pleas has indicated what the proper approach should be, and
that approach is not to give a different meaning to the words in the two
different contexts of, "were', and, "may have been", but to provide an index
as to the degree of proof then demanded which is "reasonable ground to
believe" which again means, in my understanding, as a ground of reasonable
probability.

If the Court is in a position to say, having reference to the facts of any
case, that the majority of electors may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, as a reasonable ground of belief or as a
reasonable probability, the Court it must be noted would more readily be able
to say the same when there is proof that the majority of electors were (in
fact) prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, as a matter
of certainty. That is to

124

say that if the legislature used only the wider expression, "the majority of
electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred", such expression would have been adequate to encompass the narrower
situation, where the majority of electors were (in fact) prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. Why then did the legislature use
words to include that situation as well? That perhaps was done in order to
give clarity to the expression so that the words "the majority of electors may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred" could get
their colouration from the words "the majority of electors were prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred", so as to denote a difference in
the result if any, in the sense of another candidate's success, much the same
way the Court of Common Pleas gave expression to this notion in its judgment
in the case of Woodward v. Sarsons.

If one looks at some of the early English cases, notably those decided before
the secrecy of voting provision had been introduced into the law, one may get
the impression that even a small degree of general intimidation, whatever its
effect on the result may have been (even if negligible), was considered to be
sufficient to avoid an election (see for example the response of Mr. Justice
Keogh to the arguments of Counsel in the Drogheda case that I reproduced
earlier). Such an impression would be on much the same lines as that suggested
by erroneously considering in the manner I have already pointed out, that
under section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act the ground of avoidance
reads to be understood to be general intimidation instead of the prevention of
the majority of electors from electing the candidate whom they preferred. Mr.
H. L. de Silva's strong reliance upon some of the passages in the older cases
on these lines, leads me to believe that he was himself contending for such a
view. Such an impression though, is not that which is reflected as the effect
of the cases as the Court of Common Pleas saw it in the case of Woodward v.
Sarsons. Even if the emphasis in the older cases dealing with this common law
concept had been on the cause (general intimidation) rather than on the effect
(the prevention of the majority of electors from electing the candidate whom
they preferred), with time, the emphasis appears to have shifted from cause to
effect. A possible rationale for that is perhaps that persons

125

masquerading as supporters for a particular candidate could well have brought
about that cause, as for instance in electorates of small size such as
boroughs with respect to which many of the early English cases had been
decided, and the consequence then would have been to cause prejudice to an
innocent successful candidate who found his victory taken away by a calculated
contrivance intended to secure that objective.

In 1949 there was passed in England, The Representation of the People Act
1949, section 142 of which reads thus:

"142 (1) Where on an election petition it is shown that corrupt or illegal
practices or illegal payments, employments or hirings committed in reference
to the election for the purpose of promoting or procuring the election of any
person thereat have so extensively prevailed that they may be reasonably
supposed to have affected the result, his election if he has been elected
shall be void and he shall be incapable of being elected to fill the vacancy
or any of the vacancies for which the election was held.

(2) An election shall not be liable to be avoided otherwise than under this
section by reason of general corruption, bribery, treating or intimidation."

The effect of subsection (2), it is to be seen, is to limit the voidability of
an election on grounds of general intimidation, to instances where such
intimidation is committed for the purpose of promoting or procuring the
election of a particular person at such election. As I said, there could well
have been this shift in the emphasis with the passage of time from cause to
effect as respects the English common law concept of a free and fair election,
and then The Representation of the People Act 1949, gave it a stamp of
statutory authority in section 142 (1) by providing that the avoidance of the
election was to be dependent on the effect, namely the affectation of the
result of the election.

The section also introduced a guideline as to how it may reasonably be
supposed that there has been an affectation of the

126

result. The words, "corrupt practices . . . have so extensively prevailed that
they may be reasonably supposed to have affected the result" bring out that
notion. There is therefore, an inference that is capable of being drawn as to
the affectation of the result from proof of the extensive nature that
prevailed of the corrupt practice, general intimidation being an example of
such a corrupt practice.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, if I understood him correctly, was prepared to accept that
the test implicit in this section i.e. section 142 (1) of The Representation
of the People Act 1949, is not dissimilar to that which confronts the Court
endeavouring to decide whether by reason of general intimidation the majority
of electors may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred, using the meaning given by him to these words. Though that was with
respect to the English common law concept of a free and fair election, the
same must likewise apply to section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act,
that section being in his submission, a statutory embodiment of that concept.
If however one were to examine the judgment in Woodward v. Sarsons one sees
nowhere stated, that such a test was one which a court had to adopt in
deciding the question whether the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. Similarly our
statutory provision namely, section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act,
nowhere suggests such a test in the language which the legislature thought fit
to use in framing the section. It is possible to imagine that The
Representation of the People Act 1949 introduced this test in this statutory
form ;in view of the fact that in the application of the common law concept,
there was not implicit that test. The effect of what Mr. H. L. de Silva
suggested is, as it seems to me, to ask the Court to imply the existence of
such a test from the words appearing in section 91 (a) when the actual words
of the section do not so indicate. The obvious question that arises then is as
to why, if that was the legislative intent, the section was not structured so
as to incorporate such a test. To use language similar to that contained in
section 142 (1) of The Representation of the People Act 1949, by what some may
term a process of judicial interpretation, would to my mind be in effect to
assume the function of the legislature. For myself, I do not read and
therefore cannot rewrite section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act to
introduce such a test

127

as would enable the effect, which is that the majority of electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, to be
gauged by the extent of the cause, which is the degree of prevalence of
general intimidation. Had that been the object of the legislature, the
achievement of such object would have been a matter of simple accomplishment
by the choice of language appropriate to it, and that which the legislature
has not done, I do not feel free to do.

It was submitted by Mr. H. L. de Silva that unless the section is interpreted
in the manner suggested by him, this being the only provision in the statute
having the effect of sustaining the freedom of franchise (section 91(b)
already having been emasculated in this respect by having its provisions
rendered incapable of proof), a serious blow will be struck upon the
democratic base of our political system. I am not convinced that this is so.
It will be seen that the effect of section 142 (2) of The Representation of
the People Act 1949 is to exclude general intimidation as a ground of
avoidance of an election in England when such intimidation such as of a
preventive kind, has been practised for a purpose other than the purpose of
promoting or procuring the election of a particular person at such election.
If one were to take the case of the petitioner as presented therefore, that
the general intimidation complained of was calculated, not to benefit a
particular candidate, but rather was of a kind intended to prevent all voters
from voting, than under the law in force in England after The Representation
of the People Act 1949, there would be no basis for avoiding this election. I
find it difficult to believe that in England which is often held up as an
example of a democracy at work, if it was thought that the effect of this
provision was to bring about the consequence of weakening the democratic
structure of their government, it would have been introduced into the law.

The Indian example once again demonstrates the same thing. Mr. H. L. de Silva
very properly brought to our notice the current position in that country.
Section 100 of The Representation of the People Act 1951 contained a provision
for declaring an election void if it was shown that it had not been a free one
by reason of the corrupt practices of bribery or undue influence having
prevailed extensively. However by The Representation of the People (Second

128

Amendment) Act 1956 this provision was removed and the position now in India
appears to be somewhat akin in this regard to what is to be found in England
after 1949. India too is often pointed to as a country in our part of the
world where democratic institutions are seen to function, and this despite the
change in the law in this regard.

Since the matter of the need to ensure the preservation of democratic
principles has been brought up, I think it is not out of place to make this
comment. No doubt, the Presidential Election of December 1988 was not held
when conditions were ideal in the country. But there was a time frame within
which the election had to be held, with nothing to indicate that things would
have improved in the available short term. What then were the alternatives
facing the country? The alternatives were, between holding the election at
this time, and not holding it before the last available date, a few weeks
beyond the date on which it was actually held. If the latter alternative was
chosen what would have been the result? Where would the enormous powers
granted to the President under the Constitution have come to reside? Certainly
not in the hands of one elected by the electors to exercise those powers.

The meaning of an expression must be arrived at as a matter of construction
and interpretation of the language used. That should not be done, in my
understanding, by an inquiry as to how one interprets or draws conclusions
from a given set of facts and then from what emerges, strike upon the meaning
of the expression. That would, as I see it, not be the method appropriate to
interpretation. Having decided upon the meaning of an expression, semantically
and as a matter of language, one must proceed to examine whether a given set
of facts falls within the meaning of the expression as determined. That is the
method I think appropriate to statutory interpretation. In adopting that
approach, courts have often said that if a section is unworkable or leads to
an absurd result, the remedy lies elsewhere. The Court has interpreted the
language of the section as it falls to be read within the four corners of the
statute. Even if the meaning gathered leads to an absurd result, there is
nothing the Court can do about it.

129

The method of interpretation contended for on behalf of the petitioner is, as
I have been able to understand, first to look at the facts and then from the
conclusions drawn therefrom, strike upon the meaning of the section. I have
not been able to find in Mr. H. L. de Silva's submissions any attempt at a
clear interpretation of the words, "the majority of electors were or may have
been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred", that is, an
interpretation to ascertain the meaning of the words. The closest to an
interpretation that I do find is a statement that, the words bring out the
degree of substantiality in the effect of the vitiating factors or' put
differently, that they prescribed the index or measure of the effect which the
law requires that the vitiating factors must have on the minds of the voters.
This is however not the kind of interpretation I have in mind, which is as to
an interpretation of the language as one reads and understands it. Though
undoubtedly done with admirable skill, the method he adopted was this. He said
there is the common law concept of a tree and fair election and that the
dominant attribute of that concept is the freedom of franchise. He then said
that there was at this election a shortfall in the total voter turn-out
attributable to general intimidation, the amount of such shortfall being many
times the winning candidate's majority and that therefore, there is
demonstrated that there was no freedom of franchise, thus making it possible
to say that the majority of electors may well have been prevented from
electing the candidate whom they preferred. How he sought to derive support
for what he so contended, he did not attempt to show, as far as I could see,
upon a semantic examination of the section itself, although he said that the
facts as stated by him demonstrate that the majority of electors may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. Rather, he invoked
the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat and stated that the section
understood in the way he contended against, results in it being reduced to a
dead letter but understood the way he contended for meets the requirements of
any "fact situation" contemplated by it. The maxim ut res magis valeat quam
pereat in its complete form reads thus: verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res
magis valeat quam pereat, which means that, words are to be so understood,
that the object may be carried out and not fail. To understand "words" in that
way, the language used must show that plain meaning. The basic canons of
construction demand that the language as found in the

130

section must be interpreted as found. That does not mean that one could
interpret language so as to introduce words not found. As I have said,
adopting that correct approach to interpretation may well result in the
provision being reduced to a dead letter, but that cannot be helped. The
remedy lies in the hands of others, not in those of the Court. Maxwell in his
work "The Interpretation of Statutes", 12th Edition (1976) at pages 28 and 29,
gives the effect of the authorities thus :

"The first and most elementary rule of construction is that it is to be
assumed that the words and phrases of technical legislation are used in their
technical meaning if they have acquired one, and otherwise in their ordinary
meaning, and the second is that the phrases and sentences are to be construed
according to the rules of grammar. It is very desirable in all cases to adhere
to the words of an Act of Parliament, giving to them that sense which is their
natural import in the order in which they are placed; 'The length and detail
of modern legislation', wrote Lord Evershed M. R., 'has undoubtedly reinforced
the claim of literal construction as the only safe rule'. If there is nothing
to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains, it must
be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences.
The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction
is to take the words themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning
without, in the first instance, reference to cases.

The rule of construction is to intend the Legislature to have meant what they
have actually expressed. The object of all interpretation is to discover the
intention of Parliament, but the intention of Parliament must be deduced from
the language used, . .

Where the language is plain and admits of but one meaning, the task of
interpretation can hardly be said to arise. 'The decision in this case', said
Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in a revenue case, 'calls for a full and fair
application of particular statutory language to particular facts as found. The
desirability or the undesirability of one conclusion as compared with

131

another cannot furnish a guide in reaching a decision. Where, by the use of
clear and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, anything is
enacted by the legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or absurd or
contrary to common sense the result may be. The interpretation of a statute is
not to be collected from any notions which may be entertained by the Court as
to what is just and expedient: words are not to be construed, contrary to
their meaning, as embracing or excluding cases merely because no good reason
appears why they should not be embraced or excluded. The duty of the Court is
to expound the law as it stands, and to 'leave the remedy (if one be resolved
upon), to others'.

The general rule may be stated thus: If clear in meaning, a construction will
be adopted according to that clear meaning even though the ultimate result may
be unjust, absurd or inconvenient _Attorney General v. Prince Ernest Augustus
of Hanover_ (41). If however words are not plain in meaning and there are two
possible alternative interpretations open to the Court, an interpretation
which would give this result would be avoided ( _Amoah Ababio v. Turkson_ )
_(42)_. It is only when the Court has an alternative that the question of
strict or benevolent interpretation arises and not when the words are clear in
meaning. _Warburton v Loveland_ (43).

I will now turn to certain local cases cited to ascertain how the judges who
decided them have understood the principles involved. One significant and
important difference between these cases and the present one is that in all of
them the intimidation was calculated to be beneficial to one candidate or
prejudicial to another.

The first of them would be the case of _Ratnam v. Dingiri Banda_ (5).That was
a case where the charge against the respondent was one of general intimidation
as contemplated by Article 53 of the (State Council Elections) Order in
Council 1931\. The petitioner a Ceylon Tamil received 11093 votes and the
respondent a Kandyan Sinhalese 12652 votes while two other Kandyan Sinhalese
candidates received 1484 and 204 votes respectively. Hearne, J. who tried the
case found as a fact that the intimidation was directed

132

towards obstructing the Indian voters in the expectation that their votes
would have been cast for the petitioner, and that that would have been
detrimental to the success of the candidate who was declared to have been
elected, namely the respondent. He held that freedom of choice is essential to
the validity of an election and that if by intimidation of voters that freedom
was prevented generally, the election would be void. Upon the facts before
him, he found that there had been a deliberately planned obstruction of these
voters in advance, which had the effect of eliminating this freedom. In
avoiding the election he was concerned with, the facts as found being that
there had been gross intimidation and that it was widespread in the areas
where the petitioner had good reason to count upon heavy voting in his favour,
he concluded that it might well have prevented the majority of the electors
from returning the candidate whom they preferred. It is seen therefore that as
a matter of reasonable probability Hearne J. was prepared, on the basis of
political preference, to hold in the circumstances that prevailed, that the
voters who were prevented from voting might have, if they did vote, done so
for the petitioner (involving here an element of speculation), so as to
prevent the returned candidate's victory (implying that the result was
affected).

_Pelpola v. Gunawardene_ (6) involved an election which was a straight contest
between the respondent and the petitioner and resulted in a victory for the
respondent by a comparatively narrow margin of 387 votes. One of the
allegations upon which the election was sought to be avoided was that of
general intimidation. The officer in charge of a particular polling station,
by reference to his records demonstrated to the Court that out of 1427
registered voters, only 541 did in fact vote. The evidence showed that out of
a total of 32734 voters in the whole electorate some 8375, that is over one
fourth were Indian estate labourers against whom, as a body, the acts of
intimidation in the electorate had been directed. It was also established that
the Indian Congress Committee of a particular estate decided to support the
petitioner at the election and that all the labourers had decided to vote for
him. The Court also considered it not unreasonable to suppose that the Indian
labourers of the neighbouring estates which included some who were proved to
have been molested, had likewise decided to support the petitioner. The

133

evidence suggested that the intimidation had an effect on these voters and
that if 400 more persons had voted and cast their votes for the petitioner he
would have won the election. Windham, J. who was considering section 77 (a) of
the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order-in-Council, 1946, which is in like
terms as section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act, in setting aside the
election concluded thus:

"To establish such a charge, where the general intimidation consists, as here
of local acts or threats of violence, it is only necessary for the petitioner
to show that, having regard to the majority obtained, and the strength of the
polling, the result may reasonably be supposed to have been affected. On the
figures and in the circumstances disclosed in the present case, it is at the
very least reasonable to suppose that the result of the election may have been
affected by the acts of intimidation against the Indian estate labourers."

Here too, one finds that the Court was prepared, on the basis of party
affiliation, to consider it reasonable to suppose that the voters who were
prevented from voting would have voted for the petitioner, once again
involving an element of speculation. This election too was set aside on the
basis that the result of the election may reasonably be supposed to have been
affected, meaning that the reasonable probabilities were that the returned
candidate would not have been entitled to success.

The case of _Tarnolis Appuhamy v. Wilmot Perera_ (7), which I have already
referred to, was one pertaining to an election where three candidates
contested the seat in question. The allegation there had been that there was
general intimidation in terms of section 77(a) of the Ceylon (Parliamentary
Elections) Order in Council 1946\. Nagalingam, J. in trying the case concluded
with respect to the facts, that no evidence was given of what may be termed
coercive intimidation, that is intimidation having for its object the use of
force or threat to compel a voter to vote for a particular candidate, but what
evidence was led was led to show that the election was subjected to preventive
intimidation, that is intimidation which had for its object the prevention of
electors from going to the poll lest the rival candidate

134

should get their votes, and that having regard to the number polled and to the
circumstance that this electoral area had annexed to itself the highest
percentage of voters in any electoral area in the island it was difficult to
convince anyone that voters in general were deterred by anything savouring of
intimidation from going to the polls or recording their votes. Nagalingam, J.
did make this comment, one in point of fact unnecessary for the purposes of
his decision:- "I must not, however, be understood as saying that if it is
shown that, though a large number may have polled nevertheless a fair number
of the electorate were prevented from exercising their right freely, that
would not by itself be a sufficient ground for declaring the election void,
but of this there is scarcely any proof in this case." Yet in refusing to
avoid the election he cited with approval, the statement of Gibson, J. in the
North Louth Case (supra) that "to upset an election for general intimidation
it is necessary to show that there was such general intimidation as might have
affected the result of the election".

Of much importance in this regard is also be the case of Ilangaratne v. De
Silva (2). There was an allegation in that case that by reason of
circumstances attending on or following the recent floods in the District,
including the disorganisation of the life of large sections of the voters, the
segregation of refugees who were voters, disturbance of communication and
transport and the scarcity of petrol, the majority of the electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred. Section
77(a) of the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order-in-Council 1946 was once
again invoked by the petitioner to have the election set aside. Windham, J.
was influenced by the fact of there being no evidence. from which to ascertain
whether the inmates of the refugee camps and also those other homeless persons
who found refuge with friends did in fact refrain from going to the poll and
if so why; no evidence to show what number of these persons and of the other
refugees or of other persons affected by the floods were voters; and no
evidence to show how many of such of them as were voters abstained from
polling or that if any did so abstain it was by reason of circumstances
arising from the floods. After analysing the evidence pertaining to this
charge he concluded (at page 184) thus:-

"Accordingly I cannot hold on the evidence that the majority of the electorate
were or may have been prevented from

135

electing the candidate they preferred by reason of the circumstances having
prevented them from voting for any candidate at all". (my emphasis)

These words, in particular those emphasized by me, have to my mind a high
degree of relevance to the instant case, where it is claimed that the general
intimidation was directed to prevent voters from voting at the election and
thus to prevent them from voting for any candidate at all.

In _Jayasinghe u Jayakody_ (4) Sharvananda, C.J. (at page 89) said:

"If it is proved that a corrupt practice had been committed by the returned
candidate or an election agent or by any other person with the knowledge or
consent of the returned candidate, then the Election Judge has to declare the
election void. But if the corrupt practice had been 'committed by a. person
other than the persons mentioned in section 77(c) (of the Ceylon Parliamentary
Elections Order-in-Council 1946) then it must be further established that the
majority of electors thereby were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, for the Election Judge to declare the election
void."

Thus I come to the conclusion that the words in section 91(a) of the
Presidential Elections Act which are, "the majority of electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred," have the
meaning that, had the constituency had a free and fair opportunity of electing
the candidate the majority preferred, that candidate would or may have been
someone other than the returned candidate. This would then mean that this
expression that occurs in section 91(a), has the same meaning as the
expression, "affected the result of the election" as those words appear in
section 91 (b) of the Presidential Elections Act, and that the order of the
Court on the preliminary objections intended to say so. The point of
difference is that while the words in section 91(b) have reference to a
situation of certainty, those in section 91(a) while equally having reference
to a situation of certainty, also deal with a situation of probability, which
I have interpreted as reasonable probability.

136

I have already considered the case of the petitioner on the basis of the
meaning contended for her with respect to the words, "the majority of electors
were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred" and concluded that she has failed to discharge the burden placed on
her upon that construction.

The position that then arises upon the meaning I ascribe to this expression is
that a burden is cast on the petitioner under section 91(a) to show that but
for the factor or factors complained of, being general intimidation and non-
compliance with the provisions of the elections law, or even a combination of
them, the successful candidate would or may reasonably have been someone other
than the 1st respondent.

Then the next question that may be thought to arise is how one could prove
this essential ingredient when the provisions of section 91 (a) are invoked.
To answer a question of that kind, I cannot see as being the function of a
court. The Court interprets the legal provision as found and then having
decided upon its meaning, embarks upon an examination of the facts, as found
to see whether the fact to be proved, has in fact been established. If not
proved in the Court's view, the case set up must fail. If the factum probandum
is incapable of proof, the remedy lies elsewhere. The position is explained by
Ghulam Hasan, J. of the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Vashit _Narain
Sharma v. Dev Chandra_ (44) although the case was with respect to a question
of an improper acceptance of a nomination paper, thus :

"The question is one of fact and has to be proved by positive evidence. If the
petitioner is unable to adduce evidence in a case such as the present, the
only inescapable conclusion to which the Tribunal can come is that the burden
is not discharged and that the election must stand. Such result may operate
harshly upon the petitioner seeking to set aside the election on the ground of
improper acceptance of a nomination paper, but neither the Tribunal, nor the
Court is concerned with the inconvenience resulting from the operation of the
law.

How this state of things can be remedied is a matter entirely for the
legislature to consider".

137

The petitioner's position appears to be, as I have been able to understand it,
that there is no evidence before the Court to show any affectation of the
result as a consequence of general intimidation. If her own assessment of the
evidence placed by her before the Court is to that effect as is seen by the
fact that she has not sought to identify any relevant items of evidence in
support, it would be a difficult task indeed for others to undertake a search
for such material.

Though a statement to that effect might have been sufficient in the ordinary
kind of case to draw a conclusion unfavourable to the petitioner, and thus to
dispose of the matter, in a case such as this there is a duty cast on the
Court which it should not refrain from performing, and that is to examine the
evidence though not necessarily in detail to see what relevant conclusions
could be drawn as to this aspect. There is no clear evidence which does
furnish direct proof of this requirement that I can see, and so I must ask
myself whether there is any reasonable inference that could be drawn from the
evidence considered as a whole as to an affectation of the result.

Before addressing my mind to that question it is necessary to consider a
submission made by Mr. H. L. de Silva which I have already referred to that
any exercise to determine whether the element that the result of the election
may have been affected, in the sense that but for the acts complained of
another candidate other than the one declared returned would have been
successful, would involve a computation of numbers which necessarily must be
based upon conjecture and surmise, being dependent upon circumstances totally
different and unpredictable, and therefore not something that section 91(a) of
the Presidential Elections Act could reasonably be thought to demand. He
placed much emphasis upon certain passages (at pages 21-23) from the judgment
in the case of _Shiv Charan Singh v. Chandra Bhan Singh_ (12) decided by the
Supreme Court of India. They read thus :

" The burden to prove this material effect is difficult and many times it is
almost impossible to produce the requisite proof. But the difficulty in
proving this fact does not alter the position of law. The legislative intent
is clear that unless the burden

138

however difficult it may be, is discharged, the election cannot be declared
void. The difficulty of proving the material effect was expressly noted by
this Court in Vashist Naraian Sharma and Paokai Haokip cases and the Court
observed that the difficulty could be resolved by the legislature ,and not by
the courts. Since then the Act has been amended several times, but Parliament
has not altered the burden of proof placed on the election petitioner under
section 100 (1) (d) of the Act. Therefore the law laid in the aforesaid
decisions still holds the field. It is not permissible in law to avoid the
election of the returned candidate on speculations or conjectures relating to
the manner in which the wasted votes would have been distributed among the
remaining validly nominated candidates. Legislative intent is apparent that
the harsh and difficult burden of proving material effect on the result of the
election has to be discharged by the person challenging the election and the
courts cannot speculate on the question. In the absence of positive proof of
material effect on the result of the election of the returned candidate, the
election must be allowed to stand and the Court should not interfere with the
election on speculation and conjectures . . . it is difficult to comprehend or
predicate with any amount of reasonable certainty the manner and the
proportion in which the voters who exercised their choice in favour of the
improperly nominated candidate would have exercised their votes. The courts
are ill-equipped to speculate as to how the voters could have exercised their
right of vote in the absence of the improperly nominated candidate. Any
speculation made by the Court in this respect would be arbitrary and contrary
to the democratic principles. It is a matter of common knowledge that electors
exercise their right of vote on various unpredictable considerations. Many
times electors cast their vote on consideration of friendship, party
affiliation, local affiliation, caste, religion, personal relationship and
many other imponderable considerations. Casting of votes by electors depends
upon several factors and it is not possible to forecast or guess as to how and
in what manner the voters would have exercised their choice in the absence of
the improperly ' nominated candidate."

Although the greater part of this quotation is suggestive of matters
favourable to the 1st respondent insofar as they help to sustain an

139

election, it is the latter part that Mr. H. L. de Silva really called in aid.
When he made reference to these passages, I believe they also had a contextual
relevance to his submission that arising from the shortfall in the voter turn-
out consequent upon general intimidation when compared with the majority of
votes which the 1st respondent secured, an inference could be drawn adverse to
the latter, that the majority of electors might conceivably have chosen
differently. He contended if I mistake not, that such an inference could not
be rebutted by looking at past performance of voters at earlier elections and
that voting patterns at subsequent elections are all unsafe and unreliable as
a guide.

The circumstance with reference to which the Indian Supreme Court came to use
the words it did contain in the latter part of this passage, which as I said
was what Mr. H. L. de Silva relied on especially, is indicated in the judgment
thus :

"It is manifest that law laid down by this Court in Vashit Narain Sharma case
and Paokai Haokip case holds the field and it is not permissible to set aside
the election of a returned candidate under section 100 (1) (d) on mere surmise
and conjectures".

Two things therefore are apparent from this passage, firstly and primarily,
that the Court was giving here a justification for declining to set aside the
election, in other words stating its refusal to take the serious step of
setting aside an election upon the basis of material essentially speculative
in nature and, secondly, that the Court was following the decisions in two
earlier cases, which I myself will now refer to.

In the case of _Vashit Narain Sharma v. Dev Chandra_ (44) which I have already
referred to the Court was concerned with the interpretation of a provision
which enabled an election to be set aside upon proof that "the result of the
election has been materially affected", in a context where a candidate's
nomination had been improperly accepted and consequently the votes that he
received at the election had been wasted. The Court (at page 515) said:

140

"These words seem to us to indicate that the result should not be judged by
the mere increase or decrease in the total number of votes secured by the
returned candidate but by proof of the fact that the wasted votes would have
been distributed in such a manner between the contesting candidates as would
have brought about the defeat of the returned candidate".

In my understanding of the judgment, these words constitute the Court's
statement as to the mode of proof that "the result of the election has been
materially affected". It is useful to note that the Court added (at pages 515
& 516) thus :

"But we are not prepared to hold that the mere fact that the wasted votes are
greater than the margin of votes between the returned candidate and the
candidate securing the next highest number of votes must lead to the necessary
inference that the result of the election has been materially affected. That
is a matter which has to be proved and the onus of proving it lies upon the
petitioner. It will not do merely to say that all or a majority of the wasted
votes might have gone to the next highest candidate.

The casting of votes at an election depends upon a variety of factors and it
is not possible for anyone to predicate how many or which proportion of the
votes will go to one or the other of the candidates. While it must be
recognised that the petitioner in such a case is confronted with a difficult
situation, it is not possible to relieve him of the duty imposed upon him by
section 100 (1) (c) and hold without evidence that the duty has been
discharged. Should the petitioner fail to adduce satisfactory evidence to
enable the Court to find in his favour on this point, the inevitable result
would be that the Tribunal would not interfere in his favour and would allow
the election to stand".

The case of _Paokai Haokip v. Rishang_ (45) was also concerned with the
interpretation of these identical words "the result of the election has been
materially affected" occurring in the same legislative enactment. The grounds
upon which the election was attacked were, that the polling had been disturbed
due to

141

numerous circumstances such as shutting of polling stations without due
notification thereof, and that there had been disruption of voting at certain
polling stations due to firing of guns. In deciding the case, the Court
considered the question whether the burden of proof had been discharged by the
petitioner by demonstrating to the Court either "positively" or even
"reasonably", that the poll would have gone against the returned candidate but
for the matters complained of. In searching for an answer to the test so
adopted, the Court looked at certain matters the nature of which the following
words in the judgment (at page 666) show :

"To begin with, it is wrong for the election petitioner to contend that of the
6,726 votes which were not cast, he would have received all of them. The
general pattern of polling not only in this constituency but in the whole of
India is that all the voters do not always go to the polls. In fact, in this
case, out of 219,554 voters only 120,008 cast their votes. Even if we were to
add to them the 6,726 votes, it is obvious that not more than 55% of the
voters would have gone to polls. This immediately cuts down the figure of
6,726 to a little over half and the margin from which the election petitioner
could claim additional votes therefore becomes exceedingly small. When we turn
to the pattern of voting as is disclosed in the various polling booths at
which the voters had in fact gone, we get a reasonably clear picture. At 9
polling centres, 1893 votes are actually polled. Of these, 524 votes were
received by the election petitioner and 413 by the returned candidate and 1097
votes went to the other candidates. In other words, out of 20 votes 11 went to
other candidates, 5 to the election petitioner and 4 to the returned
candidate. If one goes by the law of averages and applies these figures
reasonably to half of the votes which were not cast, it is demonstrated at
once that the election petitioner could not expect to wipe off the large
arrears under which he laboured and that he could not have therefore made a
successful bid for the seat even with the assistance of the voters who did not
cast their votes".

Of importance is-also the following passage at page 667 which reads thus :-

142

"That section requires that the election petitioner must go a little further
and prove that the result of the election had been materially affected. How he
has to prove it has already been stated by this Court and applying that test,
we find that he has significantly failed in his attempt and therefore the
election of the returned candidate could not be avoided. It is no doubt true
that the burden which is placed by law is very strict; even if it is strict it
is for the courts to apply it, It is for the Legislature to consider whether
it should be altered. If there is another way of determining the burden, the
law should say it and not the courts. It is only in given instances that,
taking the law as it is, the courts can reach the conclusion whether the
burden of proof has been successfully discharged by the election petitioner or
not".

I think these passages effectively demonstrate that the Court had been
disinclined to set aside elections, even when upon its interpretation of the
legislative provision concerned, a virtually impossible burden had been cast
upon the petitioner, but in its effort to search for the relevant material,
the Court had not hesitated to consider figures, statistics, averages etc. all
of which involve a measure of speculation and surmise.

In the cases of _Ratnam v. Dingiri Banda_ (5) and _Pelpola v. Gunawardene_ (6)
the Court was prepared to consider it reasonable to suppose that the voters
who were prevented from voting would or may have voted for the unsuccessful
candidate had it not been for the acts complained of, once again involving an
element of speculation.

In the North Louth case I have already referred to, Mr. Justice Madden thought
it proper to take into consideration voting figures relating to other
elections.

The petitioner's own position was that having regard to the national average
of voting figures demonstrated in the post-independent period in this country,
it is reasonable to state that one could have expected 80% of voters from and
out of the total number of registered voters to have voted. When one
endeavours in this manner

143

to fix upon a particular figure such as 80%, is there not involved in it
something in the nature of a statistical exercise?

There may be something to be said for any criticism of the statistical method,
because conclusions based upon statistics, not only in this area but in other
areas as well, have been demonstrated time and again to be erroneous. Indeed
in the case of _Paokai v. Rishang_ (45) already referred to Hidayatullah, C.J.
(at page 666) used these words of caution :

"While we do not think that statistics can be called in aid to prove such
facts, because it is notorious that statistics can prove anything and made to
lie for either case, it is open to us in reaching our conclusion to pay
attention to the demonstrated pattern of voting".

I believe that in a case such as this where one attempts to draw inferences,
one inevitably runs into an uncertain area of conjecture, surmise and
speculation but that is something I feel that has to be accepted as
inevitable. As I have already pointed out, statistics must always be viewed
with caution when made the basis of conclusions. Yet, in dealing with what are
necessarily hypothetical situations, such as where one endeavours to glean as
to what the position might have been if things had been different, some use of
statistics I think is permissible and indeed unavoidable. We have to look at
them and see whether they give us any guidance in this difficult area as to
whether the election should be avoided, because if one were to totally
disregard them, there may then be no guiding material whatever.

Before commencing to look at the evidence, it may perhaps be useful to state
something as to what the approach on behalf of the 1st respondent was. It was
claimed for him that there is no justification whatever for avoiding the
election, a task which a Court will not in any event lightly undertake. The
endeavour was to show that any reasonable interpretation of the evidence would
produce the converse result. Mr. Choksy sought to point out that the brunt of
the intimidation was directed at the 1st respondent's campaign, his supporters
and his party and that the adverse effects thereof were by

144

far upon him, and that these factors taken in conjunction with what the voting
patterns indicate, must result in the petitioner's case failing. Indeed it was
the 1st respondent's position that the acts of intimidation and threats of
intimidation including intimidatory posters which were directed at the United
National Party and its supporters, commenced at an earlier point of time, even
prior to the Provincial Councils elections which the petitioner's party did
not contest, and that its momentum continued throughout the period of the
Presidential Election of 1988 so that it was the members and supporters of the
1st respondent's party who during this Presidential Election had every reason
to be genuinely intimidated, having regard to the situation they had to face
and the experiences they underwent earlier.

Mr. Choksy contended that if one has regard to the voting percentages in the
1989 general election two things are demonstrated, firstly, that the increased
percentages indicate that there was an improvement in the conditions
prevailing in the country and, secondly, that such improvement which resulted
in a greater voter turn-out was beneficial to the United National Party. He
referred to the evidence of certain witnesses who testified on the lines that
there was such an improvement, evidence which I do not think necessary to
reproduce here. He also contended that there was this unusual feature in this
case which does not find a parallel anywhere else, that the 1989 general
election was held about three months after the Presidential Election of 1988
and that both elections were held on the same electoral register and with
respect to the same electoral area, namely, the whole island. He submitted
that the conclusion that has to be drawn is inevitable, that with the
increased voter turn-out there was a remarkable improvement in the performance
of the United National Party in the 1989 general election, as contrasted with
the 1st respondent's performance at the Presidential Election of 1988, which
itself showed, having regard to the brief time interval between these two
elections, that whatever shortfall there was in the voting at the 1988
Presidential Election, it worked to the disadvantage of the 1st respondent.
The point he sought to make was that the volume of evidence which he led
regarding intimidation, showed it to be directed against the United National
Party, its supporters, its trade union and other organisations,

145

its members and those connected with it, all of which had this adverse effect
on the 1st respondent's performance at the Presidential Election and that
corroboration of that position was seen by the lower voter turn-out in 1988
which gave the 1st respondent percentage of the votes cast, which was
considerably less than that which the United National Party received a mere
three months later at the general election, when conditions as he claimed were
better.

It must not be lost sight of that the petitioner and the 1st respondent,
though they contested the election as individuals, were in reality
representatives put forward by two major political parties in the island and
therefore their candidature must be viewed in that light, so that when, one
considers these figures, one must look at them largely as an index to party
preference. That being so, one must once again refrain from considering any
previous elections where there were no-contest pacts operating so that there
would then be no blurring of the figures.

The areas of electoral boundaries have changed from time to time with
delimitations, and thus a safe and adequate way of looking at any voting
pattern would, to my mind, be by reference to Provinces whose boundaries have
undergone no changes, and when we get as far as voting patterns in particular
areas, it becomes unnecessary in my view, to refer even generally to the
evidence in the case. To be able to reach the necessary conclusions in the
case in this manner, eliminates a serious disadvantage which I would otherwise
have been labouring under, namely, not having seen or heard a good many of the
witnesses who testified.

I think it is apt to state once again at this point that the secrecy of voting
provisions do not prevent the drawing of any conclusions from these voting
patterns. It could not have been of much use to have asked any voter as to the
manner in which he did vote and that is where the prohibition is. If at all,
it is the voter who did not vote who might have been asked how he would have
voted, if he had had the opportunity to do so, something I do not consider
prohibited. The affectation of the result if any is as a consequence of
preventing those who did not vote from doing so, as I have pointed out
elsewhere.

146

The question then is whether the voters who did not vote if they did vote,
would have changed the result.

One possible index would be to look at the figures of those who had in fact
voted and say that if those who did not vote did in fact vote, such extra
votes could not on the evidence be expected to have been of a greater
percentage for the petitioner than that which in the event she did receive.
To. say differently would be to say that the evidence demonstrates that those
who kept away from voting were for the most part those who would have voted
for the petitioner. I have stated elsewhere what the implications of saying so
would be, in terms of the percentages that she would have had to obtain out of
those extra votes. I do not think that the evidence in the case suggests as
reasonable such a probability. It might perhaps have been possible to
contemplate it as reasonably probable; had the relevant evidence in the case
not shown that the target of intimidation was by far the 1st respondent's
party and his supporters. There is however something else that needs to be
added here. A suggestion was made in cross-examination to certain witnesses
called for the 1st respondent, the object of which appeared to be to show that
the United National Party had become unpopular by reason of its policies and
practices and the adoption of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, and what I believe
was implied thereby was, that had the voters who did not vote in fact voted,
that would have been advantageous to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. I am not
convinced that such a point is sustainable. One could not take as a reliable
measure of popularity anything more than what the actual percentages of voters
who did vote do suggest, and that is that the majority supported the 1st
respondent. Upon that measure of popularity then as to what is suggested by
the figures of the voters who. did actually vote, the petitioner clearly not
having received the greater percentage of votes cannot be thought to have been
successful in sustaining this contention.

The other possible index may be that suggested by voting patterns, in
examining which I will refer to voter percentages by reference to the
Provinces. The figures I reproduce exclude the Northern and Eastern Provinces,
the complete figures of which I do not find available, but their absence makes
no significant difference.

valid votes cast. At the 1989 general election the United National Party
received 59.36% while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party received 32.68% of the valid
votes cast.

A synopsis of the percentages which the petitioner and her party obtained in
the aforesaid elections of 1977, 1982 and 1989 respectively are thus: Western
Province 31.63%, 40.76%, 35.89%;

149

Central Province 34.15%, 36.03%, 30.83%; Southern Province 28.88%, 42.20%,
40.41%; North Western Province 35.44%, 39.20%, 35.14%; North Central Province
39.71%, 40.98%, 37.25%; Uva Province 37.44%, 38.51%, 37.69%; Sabaragamuwa
Province 29.88%, 40.54%, 32.68%. At the Presidential Election of 1988 the
petitioner received 44.95% of the total valid votes cast. It is therefore to
be seen that her performance at that election was an improvement when compared
with the percentages I have indicated, none of them having ever exceeded
44.95%. Upon the earlier basis which I considered, I expressed the view that
upon the evidence it would not be reasonable to think that the petitioner
could be expected to have received by way of a percentage out of the votes not
cast, anything in excess of the percentage she actually did receive out of the
votes in fact cast. Allowing her as a maximum such a percentage out of the
votes not cast is then seen to be advantageous to her, as compared with a
basis made to depend on figures available from other elections.

Any objective examination of these figures, subject no doubt to the
infirmities that any' such exercise involves, does therefore demonstrate one
thing, which is, that it is not reasonably possible to say that if more voters
did vote in the 1988 Presidential Election, there would have been a benefit
accruing to the petitioner either by way of success at the election or indeed
even by way of an increased percentage so that the difference in votes between
those of the 1st respondent and herself would have become narrower. In that
state of things therefore, far from saying that there was an affectation of
the result in the sense that such result would have been favourable to the
petitioner, the reasonable probabilities suggested are the reverse and that is
that a greater voter turn-out could well have benefited the 1st respondent in
the sense that his majority may well have become greater and therefore I think
the point made by Mr. Choksy is not without some foundation. Therefore the
conclusion that I am driven to draw is that it cannot be said, even upon a
review of the evidence that the reasonable probabilities are that the majority
of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom
they preferred in the sense of the success of another candidate other than the
1st respondent, that being the petitioner herself in the circumstances of this
case.

150

The petitioner's case therefore as pleaded in paragraph 6A of her petition,
upon the basis of general intimidation as a vitiating factor under section
91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act must fail by reference to a correct
interpretation of the meaning of the words "the majority of electors were or
may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred"
understood as an affectation of the result, viewed in the light of what is
suggested by the evidence.

Some of the aspects of the case that I will hereafter proceed to advert to,
would not ordinarily have required examination, but in view of the public
interest element involved, I will make some reference to them albeit in brief.

The next aspect of the petitioner's case is that contained in paragraph 6B of
her petition which is a complaint of non-compliance with the elections law.
This, as I earlier remarked, was the ground that was abandoned by Mr. H. L. de
Silva on the basis that the Court interpreted section 91(b) so as to say that
affectation of the result was necessary to be established, and in respect of
which the petitioner has not been able to furnish the requisite proof. The
Court in its order upon the preliminary objections did hold that there was a
requirement under that section for the petitioner to establish that the result
of the election was affected by reason of non-compliance with the elections
law. There was no claim of any need to clarify anything in this regard and
therefore there arises no need to examine afresh whether it is indeed an
essential requirement under section 91(b) to establish affectation of the
result. It would suffice I think to state two things, firstly, that apart from
the authorities, the plain language of the section supports the view of the
need to establish affectation of the result and therefore the Court's
interpretation of section 91(b) of the Act upon its order on the preliminary
objections is correct and secondly, that the petitioner's own estimate of the
evidence. led in the case, that there is no evidence showing affectation of
the result, can undoubtedly be accepted without debate and that in any case an
independent examination of that evidence does reveal that to be the correct
position. In the circumstances, the ground pleaded in paragraph 6B of the
petition has not been established and must fail.

The next matter to consider is the ground as pleaded in paragraph 6C of the
petition which is that the pleaded items of non-compliance

151

with the elections law also constituted a basis of avoidance under section
91(a), as another "circumstance". In dealing with the petitioner's case based
upon general intimidation, I have also dealt with such aspect of her case as
pertains to what is pleaded in paragraph 6C of the petition and having regard
to the conclusion I have reached with respect to the case based upon general
intimidation, the latter question does not I think require any further
independent examination. The requirement being that it is incumbent under
section 91(a) to establish that the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, it was incumbent on
the petitioner to show that by reason of non-compliance with the elections law
referred to, the consequence was that the wrong candidate was declared elected
or may be reasonably thought to have been declared elected. There is no
evidence affording proof as to that, and therefore the case of the petitioner
as pleaded in paragraph 6C of her petition must also fail.

There then is the position taken by Mr. H. L. de Silva for the petitioner
different from what is pleaded in paragraph 6C ;of the petition, that the non-
compliance with the elections law pleaded was not something for which the 2nd
respondent was accountable or responsible, but that the acts of general
intimidation complained of resulted in a breakdown of the machinery of
election, so that taken in conjunction with the general intimidation itself
which led to that breakdown there was demonstrated another circumstance as
that word is used in section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act and
constituting a basis of avoidance thereunder. The learned Attorney General Mr.
Marapana, then the Solicitor-General, quite understandably reacted in protest
so as to indicate that that was not the case he was called upon to meet upon
the petition, and that it was one of a radically different nature from what he
had throughout addressed his mind to. Mr. H. L. de Silva's response was that
with the pressure brought about by the limited time period allowed by law for
the filing of the petition, the petitioner was constrained to structure her
petition as best as could be done in the circumstances, but that the Court
should nevertheless investigate this complaint as all the relevant material
for doing so is before it. I am far from agreeing with what I may term that
explanation, based upon a claim of lack of time. The petitioner, possessed as
she obviously was of the material

152

pleaded as constituting instances of non-compliance with the elections law,
did not need much more by way of other material or time, in order to aver that
such non-compliance was the result of the general intimidation complained of,
without stating her case the way it has been done on the petition.

The relevant paragraph in her petition numbered 6C which I have already
reproduced uses the words "the failure of the Commissioner or Elections (the
Second Respondent ) and/or certain members of his staff to conduct a fair and
free election in accordance with the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of
1981, more particularly set out in paragraph 9 read with paragraph 8 hereof".
The plea relating to noncompliance with the elections law as a ground of
avoidance under section 91(b) of the Presidential Elections Act is what is
referred to in paragraph 8 of the petition and is the abandoned ground.
Paragraph' 8 also uses the words "by reason of non-compliance with the
undermentioned provisions of the Act by the Election Commissioner and/or
members of his staff and officers employed for the conduct of the election",
suggesting that blame therefore should be laid at the feet of the 2nd
respondent. The plea relating to non-compliance with the elections law as a
basis for avoidance of the election under section 91 (a) of the Act is what is
contained in paragraph 9 of such petition. It mentions nothing even remotely
suggesting a link with general intimidation.

To allow the petitioner therefore to urge a case founded upon an entirely
different basis which seeks to attribute non-compliance with the elections law
to the existence of general intimidation, and thus to seek to have the
election declared void, would be, as I see it totally unfair and which I for
one, do not consider as meeting the requirements of justice. Non-compliance
with the elections law as another "circumstance" as contemplated by section
91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act is one thing, but non-compliance
occurring as a result of general intimidation committed by others and thereby
forming an aspect of the case based upon general intimidation is altogether
another, and indeed one upon which the 2nd respondent need not, as of
necessity, have been made a party to the petition. Properly speaking the new
position taken could not be characterised as non-compliance with the elections
law, but rather, would indicate

153

that the 2nd respondent was rendered incapable of complying with such law, or
that he failed to comply with such law by reason of causes beyond his control
and therefore all the pleadings on this limb of the petitioner's case as they
appear in the petition must fail. As I have pointed out, the ground of
avoidance under section 91 (a) is one upon which the majority of electors were
or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred.
The agency by which or the cause as a result of which the majority of electors
were or may have been so prevented could be the prevalence of general
intimidation or a non-compliance with the elections law. If it is the
petitioner's case that such agency or cause was general intimidation, which in
turn brought about a failure of the machinery of election, which once again
produced the effect that the majority of electors were or may have been
prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred, the petition as a
matter of pleadings should have contained a clear statement on those lines.
What the petitioner endeavours therefore is, to do indirectly what she would
not have been permitted to do directly, that is to present a case different
from that pleaded in her petition, and so in effect, amending such petition in
this very important regard. In principle, to permit such a course would not be
to conform either to the letter or to the spirit of the law. Nevertheless it
may usefully be added that even if the petitioner's case be looked at in this
way, she does not overcome the effect of the absence of evidence to show that
the majority of the electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred, the factual position here being that which I
pointed out with regard to her case based on general intimidation.

As stated earlier, when Mr. H. L. de Silva was addressing the Court with
respect to the petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6C of the petition
based upon a claim of non-compliance with the provisions of the elections law
as another circumstance upon which it was sought to have the election set
aside under section 91(a), he adopted a new approach to the case, subject to
one claimed exception regarding which as I have said there was no clear
statement nor any submissions made, so that there is no strict need to deal
with that exception. However for the sake of completeness, something may be
said about what I was able to gather to be that

154

exception, which was a reference to the electoral district of Moneragala. The
allegation in the petition is that the polling in 49 polling stations was
declared null and void by the 2nd respondent resulting in a failure to comply
with section 46A of the Act or that there was a failure to take into account
that the votes polled at those polling stations or those which would have been
polled, would have affected the result of the election. It was accepted by Mr.
Marapana that in the circumstances prevailing, the. 2nd respondent was
compelled to do so, acting under the provisions of section 46A introduced by
way of amendment into the Presidential Elections Act No. 15 of 1981 by the
Elections (Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1988. Section 46A makes provision
for a situation as prevailed at those polling stations and it empowers the
Commissioner of Elections to act as he did, provided that he is of the opinion
that the result of the election for such electoral district would not be
affected by the failure to count the votes polled or the votes that would have
been polled at such polling stations. Before doing so however, the
Commissioner of Elections is called upon to consult the candidates or their
agents. In the course of evidence led for the 2nd respondent, the document
1R27 was produced. Such document which relates to a meeting held with the
agents of the parties on 20.12.1988 shows that the agent of the petitioner had
agreed with the 2nd respondent's view that the result of the election would
not have been affected by the failure to count the votes that would have been
polled in those polling stations. In these circumstances I think that. it is
"not permissible for the petitioner to make a complaint with respect to the
failure to conduct the poll at these 49 polling stations. In any event, even
otherwise, the number involved being only 49 out of 8025 polling stations in
the island and there being no basis upon which to say how the voters at these
polling stations would have voted, there is no material upon which to say that
the result of the election for such electoral district would have been
affected, or that at the election the majority of the electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred:

I would summarise then the effect of my findings thus :

1\. With respect to the petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6A of her
petition based upon general intimidation I hold that the

155

 petitioner has failed to establish the allegation that the majority of the
electors were or may have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they
preferred by reason of general intimidation as required by section 91 (a) of
the Presidential Elections Act.

2\. With respect to the petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6B of her
petition based upon the ground of non-compliance with the elections law I hold
that the petitioner has failed to establish that the result of the election
was affected as required by section 91(b) of the Presidential Elections Act.

3\. With respect to the petitioner's case as contained in paragraph 6C of her
petition based upon the claim of a failure to conduct a fair and free election
in accordance with the provisions of the elections law, I hold that the
petitioner has failed to prove that the majority of the electors were or may
have been prevented from electing the candidate whom they preferred as
required by section 91(a) of the Presidential Elections Act.

4\. With regard to the case urged for the petitioner at the stage of addresses
that by reason of a large-scale breakdown of the electoral machinery taken in
conjunction with the acts of intimidation established, there was another
circumstance shown to exist upon which the election was liable to be avoided,
I hold that the petitioner cannot in any event succeed thereon on the basis
that the majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing
the candidate whom they preferred under the provisions of section 91(a) of the
Presidential Elections Act.

5\. With respect to the pleaded complaint that the poll at 49 polling stations
was declared null and void which was perhaps what was referred to by learned
Counsel for the petitioner during his address, I hold that the petitioner has
not in any event established that the 2nd respondent failed to conduct a fair
and free election in accordance with the elections law so as to say that the
majority of electors were or may have been prevented from electing the
candidate whom they preferred as required by section 91(a) of the Presidential
Elections Act.

156

In the result I determine that the 1st respondent was duly elected and
returned to the office of President and accordingly I make order dismissing
this petition.

There then remains the question of costs. The view I have been consistently
holding, a view I did express during the hearing, was that the large and
detailed volume of evidence led was only of marginal importance, and that view
I believe is reflected in my approach to the decision of this case. I
therefore think that it might have been possible for the trial of this case to
have been considerably shortened and for the parties to have saved themselves
a good deal of expenditure. Taking that factor into account along with the
factor of the public interest element involved in the case, I would make no
order as to costs.

_Election Petition dismissed with costs._
