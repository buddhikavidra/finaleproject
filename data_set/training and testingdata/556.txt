_     Donation - Revocability - Donatio propter nuptias - When may a point be
raised for the first time in appeal? - Definition of "gift" \- Burden of proof
- Ingratitude - Can a single Act constitute ingratitude?_

Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike (appellant) married Edmund Perera Senanayake
and they had one child Rohini Senanayake (respondent). By Deed No. 3412 of 11
July 1967 Dona Podi Nona and her husband gifted Apaladeniya Estate to their
only child, a daughter named Rohini (respondent) reserving to themselves their
life interest. The gift was given on the occasion of and in consideration of
the marriage of their daughter Rohini to one Yasaratne Perera who was a co-
donee on the said deed. Rohini married Yasaratne Perera on 17 August 1967 but
the marriage was subsequently dissolved by decree entered in D.C. Kurunegala
Case No. 3629 on 30 July 1975.

181

On 10 April 1979 the respondent Rohini assaulted her parents. Dona Podi Nona
and her husband filed the present action against the respondent Rohini and her
ex-husband Yasaratne Perera seeking the revocation of the gift on the ground
of gross ingratitude manifested by assault. The District Court gave judgment
allowing the revocation but the Court of Appeal held that the transaction was
a donatio propter nuptias and that since the contemplated marriage had taken
place the gift was, as a matter of law, not revocable on account of
ingratitude and set aside the judgment.

The point that a donation in consideration of marriage (donatio propter
nuptias) cannot be revoked where the marriage has taken place was not taken up
in the District Court.

**Held:**

(1) A matter that has not been raised before might, nevertheless, be a ground
of appeal on which the appellate court might base its decision provided it is
a pure question of law; or, if the point might have been put forward in the
Court below under one of the issues raised, and the Court is satisfied (1)
that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as
completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the
trial, and (2) that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by the
other side, if an opportunity had been afforded it, of adducing evidence with
regard to the point raised for the first time in appeal. The matter is not one
depending simply on the issue whether the new point was one of law, on the one
hand, or a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, on the other.

(2) What the parties may name a transaction to be or how they describe its
purpose is not conclusive. In interpreting a deed the relevant question is
what was the donor's intention or primary motive? In the case of a gift, the
intention or primary motive should be the enrichment of the donee, for the
sake of enrichment. The crucial test is whether the donor was moved or induced
to give his property simply by the desire to enrich the donee: whether that
which influenced his volition was liberality.

The question then is this, was the transfer of Apaladeniya Estate simply made
to enrich the respondent and her prospective bridegroom for the, sake of
enriching them, so that it might be assumed that the property was
unconditionally, unalterably and irreversibly given and, as it were abandoned,
and. put beyond hope of being ever called, or taken back or recovered by
undoing and revoking the transaction?

182

(3) It is for the party seeking the assistance of a court for the revocation
of a gift "properly so called' to prove on a balance of probabilities, that
the transfer of the property was a pure act of disinterested benevolence and
liberality. A donation must be clearly and distinctly proved and must not be
presumed as long as some other construction is possible. Where the terms of
the deed, ex facie show that it was a gift, the burden of adducing evidence to
show that in fact in substance in reality a dohatio propter nuptias, is on the
person who claims that it was a special kind of gift.

(4) (a) Although a gift is generally irrevocable it is revocable

(i) if the donee failed to give effect to a direction as to its application
(donatio sub mode), or

(ii) on the ground of the donee's ingratitude or

(iii) if at the time of the gift the donor was childless but afterwards became
the father of a legitimate child by birth or legitimation.

A donor is entitled to revoke a donation on account of ingratitude.

(i) if the donee lays manus impias (impious hands) on the donor.

(ii) If he does him an atrocious injury

(iii) If he wilfully causes him great loss of property

(iv) If he makes an attempt on his life

(v) if he does not fulfil the conditions attached to the gift

(vi) other, equally grave causes.

(b) Other conveyances not made out of pure liberality like a conveyance
propter nuptias are irrevocable on account of the donee's ingratitude or on
account of the appearance of progeny by birth or legitimation.

(5) In form deed No. 3412 was a gift and therefore ex facie the conveyance was
an act of liberality and not motivated by valuable consideration.

(6) A donatio propter nuptias is in one sense, made in consideration of
marriage in that the transfer made is having regard to the fact that a
marriage should be entered into. The property is given because, in the sense
that in order or so that the marriage shall take place. It is the reason why
the marriage takes place. It is that which brings about the promise of
marriage or the wedding. The property is given, more or less, as something
akin to a payment, something given in exchange, a quid pro quo, or reward or
compensation. The transfer is prompted by the promise or performance of
something by the donee, thereby making it a donatio non mera and not a pure
act of liberality (donatio mera).

183

(7) In deed No. 3412 the reservation of the life interest showed that the
conveyance was not propter nuptias. The enjoyment of the property was
postponed. It was a case of dies cedis sed not venit. The conveyance here was
a present by their parents to their only child simply to enrich her for the
sake of enrichment on the joyful occasion of her marriage, which was an
appropriate event for giving a present. It was not a requite or recompense,
not part of the bargain or a sort of exchange, from the donee's point of view,
the transfer of the property was not a condition of the marriage. It did not
form the consideration or part of the consideration, in the sense of an
inducement or a quid pro quo for the parties getting married. It was a gift
pure and simple - a gift properly so called. In form and substance it was an
ordinary gift and therefore revocable on the ground of ingratitude.

The principles that apply to a donatio propter nuptias cease to be applicable
when a marriage in consideration of which a gift was made ceases to exist.

Whether it was an ordinary gift or a donatio propter nuptias, on dissolution
of the marriage it becomes an ordinary gift revocable for ingratitude.

Slight acts of ingratitude are insufficient for revocation. What amounts to an
act of ingratitude sufficient to warrant revocation must vary with the
circumstances of each case. Ingratitude is a form of mind which has to be
inferred from the donee's conduct. Such an attitude of mind will be indicated
either by a single act or a series of acts. The donee-daughter by assaulting
her donor-parents was guilty of the foul offence of ingratitude. Revocation is
not however automatic. It requires a decision of the court.

Per Amerasinghe J. (obiter)

"A property which is, liable to be returned upon an order for revocation on
account of ingratitude, does not include the fruits of the property upto the
time of joinder of issue ... further, a property donated cannot be claimed for
ingratitude if the donee, in good faith and without any intention to defraud
the donor, had alienated the property by sale, donation, exchange, dowry or
transfer on account of any law, cause whatsoever."

_Cur. adv. vult._

21st August, 1992.  
**AMERASINGHE, J.**

This is an action concerning the revocability of a gift of a land called
Apaladeniya Estate belonging to Ranaviraratne Arachchige Dona Podi Nona
Ranaweera Menike (hereinafter, sometimes, simply referred to as the
"appellant").

The appellant was married to Mallawa Arachchige Edmund Perera Senanayake. The
appellant and her husband had one child, Mallawa Arachchige Rohini Senanayake,
(hereinafter, sometimes, simply referred to as the "respondent").

A marriage had been arranged between the respondent and Panduwala
Kankanamalage Yasaratne Perera. I shall refer to him, sometimes, simply as
"Perera". On 11 July 1967, by Deed No. 3412, drawn and attested by C. D. C. W.
Senaratne, Proctor and Notary Public, - a fact which we shall see, later on,
is of some importance - the appellant and her husband, reserving to themselves
a life interest, donated Apaladeniya Estate to their daughter, the respondent,
and to Perera. The deed, inter alia, stated as follows:

No. 3412  
DEED OF GIFT Rs. 50,000/-

187

Where as a marriage has been arranged and is intended shortly to take place
between Mallawa Aratchchige Rohini Senanayake ... the only child of the said
donors; and Panduwala Kankanamalage Yasaratne Perera ...

And Whereas the donors have decided to donate the premises ... on the occasion
of and in consideration of the said marriage ... the gift or donation to take
effect on the marriage of the donees but to be subject to the life interest
(of the donors)...

Now know Ye and these presents witness that the said donors in consideration
of the marriage of the donees do hereby give grant convey transfer assign set
over and assure unto the said donees, subject to the life interest of the said
donors as hereinbefore recited, as a gift to take effect on the marriage of
the donees, (Apaladeniya Estate) ... to have and to hold the said premises
hereby gifted and assigned or intended so to be ... for ever from the marriage
of the donees, subject only to the life interest of the (donors). .

And know all Ye by these presents that the said donees.. . . do hereby
gratefully and thankfully accept the above gift or donation made to them by
these presents ......

The Marriage between the respondent and Perera took place on 17 August 1967.
The marriage, however, was dissolved, after legal proceedings in D.C.
Kurunegala Case No. 3629, on 30 July 1975\. On 10 April 1979, the respondent
assaulted her parents. The appellant (and her husband) filed action seeking
the revocation of the deed of gift on the ground of gross ingratitude
manifested by the assault. The District Court allowed the revocation of the
gift on the ground of gross ingratitude. When the matter came up for hearing
in the Court of Appeal, it was argued that the transaction was a donatio
propter nuptias, and that, since the contemplated marriage had taken place,
the gift was, as a matter of law, not revocable on account of ingratitude. The
Court of Appeal agreed with this submission, and, on 24 January 1991, it set
aside the order of the District Court. Special leave to appeal to this Court
from the order of the Court of Appeal was granted on 29 July 1991.

188

Johannes Voet, Commentaries ad Pandectas, (xxiii.1.1), begins his commentary
on Betrothals (De Sponsalibus) with the following words:

Si quae juris nostri portio natural's fit, si quae usu hominum frequenta, quae
tames simul togatos in foro saepissime exercet, atque magnis inter se animis
committit, est certe ea, qui de nuptiis, earumque praeambulonibus sponsalibus,
comitibus, dotibus pactisque dotalibus, ac denique quam Plurimis momenti
maximi effectibus tractatio instituitur.

Mr. Justice Percival Gane (Selective Voet, 1957) translated that passage as
follows:

If there is any essential portion of our law, any portion which is freely
employed in the usage of mankind, but which nevertheless at the same time very
often gives such ado to the gowned gentlemen in the Courts, and sets them
fighting with great mutual spirit, it is surely that portion in which is
undertaken the treatment of marriage, of the betrothals which walk before it,
of the dowries and dotal agreements which accompany it, and finally of its
very many and weighty effect.

However, reported decisions in Sri Lanka on the subject of what Voet
(xxiii.1.1) referred to as "dowries and dotal agreements", based on the Roman
Dutch Law, which we have to apply in this case, are not many; and, there are
none, it seems, on the question of the revocability of a conveyance of
property given on the occasion of a marriage which has been subsequently
dissolved. (There are,- of course, several reported decisions on the
interpretation of marriage settlements in the context of specific statutes,
like the Stamps Ordinance, to which the principles of English Law have been
applied, as well as decisions on the revocability of gifts under Kandyan Law,
which have no direct relevance to the matter before us.)

Learned Counsel for the the appellant, Mr. Samarasekera, P.C., submitted that
the Court of Appeal was in error for the following reasons:

189

(1) If the matter of revocability was to be decided on a question of law, that
question should, in terms of Section 75 of the Civil Procedure Code, have been
set out in detail in the answer filed in the District Court. In terms of
Explanation 2 to Section. 150 of the Civil Procedure Code, a Party cannot be
allowed at the trial to make a case materially different from that which he
has placed on record for his opponent to meet. In appeal, in terms of the
Scheme of Chapter LXl of the Civil Procedure Code, a party cannot be taken by
surprise by an entirely new position being taken up which had not been raised
before.

(2) If the Court of Appeal was right in assuming that it could decide a case
on the basis of a question that had not been raised earlier, because it was a
question of law, yet it was not entitled to do so in this case, where the
question was_ not a pure question of law, but a mixed question of law and
fact. Since the question had not been raised earlier, the appellant had no
opportunity of adducing evidence in support of her contention that the gift
was not made propter nuptias, but rather, that it was a pure act of liberality
and generosity. A decision that the conveyance was irrevocable without the
benefit of evidence on that matter was unjustifiable, since the characteristic
quality of revocability, attached to certain kinds of gifts, depended on the
nature of the gift established by the facts.

(3) The co-donee, Perera, who had been made a party to the revocation
proceedings, had not objected to the revocation, although, if the transaction
was a donatio propter nuptias, it was he, as the person who might have been
induced by the gift to enter into marriage, and not the respondent, who was
entitled to complain of the revocation.

(4) Assuming that a donatio nuptias had taken place, and assuming that such a
gift is generally irrevocable, if the marriage had taken place and during the
subsistence of the marriage, yet, in this case, the nature of the gift altered
upon the dissolution of the marriage and became revocable. Then, by reason of
the donee-daughter's ingratitude, manifested by her laying of impious hands on
her donorparents, the donor-appellant qualified to seek the assistance of the

190

Court to revoke the donation. The effect of the dissolution of the marriage on
the question of revocability had not been considered by the Court of Appeal.

Learned Counsel for the respondent, Mr. Daluwatte, P.C., supported the
decision of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds:

(1) Although the Court of Appeal decided the matter on the basis of an
argument that had not been adduced earlier, the new submission related to a
question of pure law which, therefore, could have been raised at any time.

(2) In any event, the point was one that might have been raised at the trial
under issue No. 2 framed by the doner plaintiff, and the Court of Appeal had
all the requisite material in the record for deciding that point. The question
of the nature of the gift in this case had to be ascertained from the words in
the deed of conveyance itself, and not by reference to extrinsic evidence.
Other evidence was inadmissible and would not have been of avail, and its
absence could not have prejudiced the appellant.

(3) A conveyance on account of liberality is revocable, but not one for
"valuable consideration". A gift in consideration of marriage" is a conveyance
for valuable consideration". It is given in the discharge of an obligation
owed by a parent to a child so that the donee may be able to shoulder the
burdens of marriage. And so, a donatio propter nuptias is not made out of pure
liberality, but on account of "cause". As a result of, or in consideration, of
the marriage gift, a change of status took place. The "consideration" in this
case brought about the alteration of civil status. Since the marriage took
place, consequent upon the making of the gift propter nuptias, the contract
was complete and irrevocable, and the subsequent dissolution of the marriage
did not make the conveyance revocable.

(4) A gift in consideration of marriage is an incentive to both the bride and
bridegroom, and, therefore, the fact that the revocation was not opposed by
the appellant's co-donee, is without significance.

191

(5) The alleged assault had not been established. In any event, it was a case
of "slight ingratitude" and, therefore, revocation was not warranted. A single
blow or a single act of ingratitude is insufficient to warrant revocation.

A matter that has not been raised before might, nevertheless, be a ground of
appeal on which an appellate court might base its decision, provided it is a
pure question of law; or, if the point might have been put forward in the
court below under one of the issues raised, and the court is satisfied (1)
that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as
completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the
trial, and (2) that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by the
other side, if an opportunity had been afforded it, of adducing evidence with
regard to the point raised for the first time in appeal. The opinion expressed
on this matter by Lord Herschell in _The Tasmania_ (1)has consistently formed
the basis of our law on this question. (See _Appuhamy v. Nona_ (2), _Manian v.
Shanmugam_ (3), _Attorney-General v. Punchirala_ (4), _Attorney-General v.
Croos_ (5), _Fernando v. Abeygunasekera_ (6), _Talagala v Gangodawila
Cooperative Stores Society Ltd_.(7), _Arulampikai v. Thambu_ (8), _Seetha v.
Weerakoon_ (9), _Dassanayake v. Eastern Produce and Estates Co. Ltd._ (10),
_Ceylon Ceramics Corporation v. G. G. Premadasa_ (11) . Therefore, the
question before us is not, with great respect, as it appears to have been
supposed in Jayawickrama v. David Silva (12), and by the Court of Appeal in
this case, and by learned counsel in the matter before us, to be one depending
simply on the issue whether the new point raised was one of law, on the one
hand, or a question of fact or a mixed question of law and fact, on the other.

Mr. Daluwatte quickly appreciated the difficulty of insisting that the novel
point raised in the Court of Appeal was a pure question of law. He argued,
instead, that the submission relating to revocability might have been put
forward in the District Court under the second issue raised by the plaintiff,
namely, whether on account of the alleged assault by the donee, the donor was
entitled to revoke the gift given by deed No. 3412? I will assume this to be
so. However, were all the facts bearing upon the new contention before the
Court of Appeal? Was the donor prejudiced by having no opportunity to adduce
evidence to explain that the transaction

192

 was not a donatio propter nuptias? Mr. Daluwatte submitted that the nature of
the transaction was, in terms of the Evidence Ordinance, only ascertainable by
considering the terms of the deed itself. And, since no prejudice could be
caused by the lack of other evidence, no objection to the raising of the
question on the ground of novelty should, he said, be sustained.

Although Mr. Daluwatte raised them, I do not need to, and therefore, do not
consider either the large question of the admissibility, in general, of
extrinsic evidence to contradict, vary, add to or subtract from the terms of
written agreements, or the equally broad question whether extrinsic evidence
might be adduced for the purpose of showing the meaning or supplying the
defects of an ex facie ambiguous or defective deed. It was neither the
appellant's case, nor that of the respondent, that the deed in the case before
us was ambiguous or defective. Nor did either party seek to contradict, vary,
add to, or subtract from its terms: Mr Daluwatte said that the Court of Appeal
had properly done so, and invited us also to decide the question of the nature
of the deed solely by reference to its terms. I am quite content to do so, for
I think, that such an approach does, in the circumstances of this case, lead
me to a just result.

However, if we should only look at the Deed, how should I consider its terms?
I should like to refer to certain decisions relating to the interpretation of
Deeds, which I think, are helpful in deciding the matter before me. The
emphasis in the following passages is mine.

In the matter of an _Application of A. K. Chellappa_ (13), the question was
this: What was the character of the conveyance for the purposes of the Stamp
Ordinance? The deed had said that the conveyance by the parents to their
daughter was a "settlement by way of mudusam. De Sampayo, J. (at p. 119)
explained that

"mudusam Property in Jaffna law is distinguished on the one hand from dowry
and on the other hand from acquired property. It signifies inherited property,
and the word can only be regarded as employed here to indicate that the donee
was to hold the subject of the gift as inherited property, and not a dowry or
acquired property. It does not by any means satisfy the definition of
"settlement" in the Stamp Ordinance".

193

The affidavits submitted to clarify the nature of the transaction were not
convincing. His Lordship said:

"I think that a notary or party who wishes to brings an instrument within a
particular description for the purpose of regulating the stamps must see that
the instrument itself discloses its nature."

In that case Wood Renton, C.J. said:

"There must, I think, be something in the instrument itself to show that it is
a settlement **within the meaning of the statutory definition. The mere use of
the term "settlement" cannot make fit one. Nor can any inference in favour of
the appellant's contention properly be drawn from the term mudusam. I am
inclined to think that the notary had inserted the word "settlement" in the
deed with a view to evade the stamp duty with which the Instrument was
properly chargeable. But, be that as it may, the Instrument itself is simply a
deed of donation.** No authority was cited to us in support of the
proposition, and in the absence of authority, I decline to hold that an
instrument of this nature can be changed from a deed of gift into a settlement
by extrinsic evidence . . .

_In the matter of an Application of Notary Abeyratne_ (14), where the question
was whether the deed was properly stamped in terms of the Stamps Ordinance,
the Court held that the decision in Chellappa was correct and applicable, the
extrinsic evidence adduced, in any event, being "insufficient".

Following the decisions in _In re A. K. Chellappa_ (13), and _In re Abeyratne_
(14), (both of which were cases relating to the interpretation of the Stamps
Ordinance), Bertram C.J. in In the Matter of the _Application of v.
Coomaraswamy_ (15), said:

"In determining this question we have to look at the terms of the document
itself. We are precluded from making any inquiry into the circumstances under
which it was given, and considering any evidence aliunde as to the nature and
the purpose of the deed ...

194

We have, therefore, to ask ourselves whether upon the face of the document it
is in substance a deed of gift. For that purpose it does not matter what it
may be called. We have to determine from what appears within the four corners
of the document its essential nature."

_In Ponnamperuma v. Goonesekera_ (16), De Sampayo, J., it seems was somewhat
more flexible in his approach than Bertram, C.J. had been in Coomaraswamy, and
not altogether averse to going beyond the four corners of the deed in
ascertaining its nature. His Lordship said at p. 239 as follows:

It is to be noted that the promise and the actual gift was not to the fifth
defendant but to Karonchihamy, so that an element of this kind of donation is
absent. Moreover, neither the informal writing nor the deed shows that the
gift was given as an inducement for the marriage. They do not even call it a
dowry. Lastly, it was revoked with the concurrence of the done herself, and
not at the' instance of Juvanis Silva alone. Both in form and substance it is
an ordinary gift, though the promise may have been given on the occasion of
the marriage between the first defendant and Karonchihamy. I should say that
the nature of the gift, if it is to be claimed as being of a special kind,
should be disclosed in the instrument itself. But even if extrinsic oral
evidence is admissible, I think the evidence falls far short of what is
necessary. The only evidence on the point is that of the fifth defendant, and
all that he says is: "I am married to a niece of plaintiff's vendor Juwanis in
1904. Juvanis agreed to give as dowry half of Bamboragewatta." In my opinion
the gift cannot be considered as a donation propter nuptias in the true sense
of the expression."

The Court of Appeal had before it (at pages 19&212 of the Brief) the terms of
Deed No. 3412. What was the nature of the transaction according to its terms?
It is described in the caption of that document as a "Deed of Gift". Is the
descriptive heading in the deed, calling it a "deed of gift", not, Prima
facie, indicative of its nature? It is also described in the body of the
document as a "gift or donation". Moreover, in that document, the givers
describe themselves as "donor", the recipients are described as done who
accept the land as "a gift or donation".

195

The property is given "as a gift to take effect on the marriage of the
donees", and the property is said to be "gifted and assigned". The "donees"
accept the gift 'gratefully and thankfully'. Does this not indicate that the
property was being received as a consequence of an act of liberality rather
than as something obtained as a matter of right? In the circumstances, may we
not, with justification, say, as Wood Renton, C.J. did in Chellappa (supra),
that the "instrument was simply a deed of donation." and not a marriage
settlement? Should we not, as De Sampayo, J. did in Ponnamperuma v.
Goonesekera, (supra), note that the donors "do not even call it a dowry" and
conclude that the "gift cannot be considered as a donation propter nuptias in
the true sense of the expression"? Having regard to the words used, should we,
not conclude that the transaction was a "gift", as Mr. Samarasekera contends,
and not, as Mr. Daluwatte submits, a "dowry"? I think it was a gift at least
in form. Might we also conclude, as the Court did in Ponnamperuma (supra),
that it was a gift in substance?

It has been laid down in several decisions that we ought to ascertain the
"real", "actual", "essential" nature of a transaction, what it was "in
substance", what it was "in fact", regardless of the labels and technical
phrases or words, the parties, or their notary, might have chosen to employ.
For one thing, the parties may deliberately use inaccurate terms with ulterior
purposes, such as evading the provisions of the Stamps Ordinance, as, for
instance, Wood Renton, C.J. found in Chellappa (supra). Further, the nature of
a document is a question of law to be determined by a court; and in doing so,
a court does not permit itself to be misled by the terminology used in the
document.

In _Jayasekera v. Wanigaratna_ (17), Hutchinson C.J. observed: "The fact of
the deed being called a "deed of gift" cannot make any difference if it is
clearly proved what the real nature of it was." In _Re the Application of K.
S. Veeravagu_ (18), although the deed of conveyance from the parents to their
daughter described it as a "dowry deed", and although in the operative portion
it purported to convey the lands "by way of dowry in consideration of the
marriage" of the daughter, it was held that it was in fact a deed of gift. De
Sampayo, J. observed that "The donee had already been given in marriage, but
as, under the customary law prevailing in Jaffna, a dowry may be given at,
before, or after the marriage, the fact of the marriage being prior to the
deed would not make it any the less a dowry, if in fact, it was one."

196

Veeravagu (supra) was followed with approval by Schneider, J. In _Re the
Application of Goonesekera_ (19). In that case, counsel contended that the
deed under consideration was executed by a Muhammadan husband in favour of his
wife after the consummation of the marriage for the mahar, which under the
Muhammadan law, a husband is under an obligation to pay to the bride, and
that, therefore, the consideration for the deed was a debt due. As such, it
was for a pecuniary consideration and was a transfer. Schneider, J. rejected
that submission, observing that ". . . the instrument must be looked into, and
the actual consideration for the transaction gathered from it. It is of no
importance what the parties to it may call or describe the transaction ... The
real consideration for the deed in question is not money or its equivalent
paid by the wife to the husband, but that with which the husband dowers the
wife in consideration of her marriage. . ."

Veeravagu (supra) and Goonesekera (supra) were followed with approval by
Bertram, C.J. and Jayewardene, J. In the matter of the _Application of V.
Coomaraswamy_ (15). The document in that case stated that "in consideration"
of the sum of Rs. 1500 agreed to be given by the father to his daughter as
"dowry money", he transferred certain mortgage bonds to her. Bertram, C.J.
said that the Court had to determine the "essential nature" of the document
and whether it was "in substance a deed of gift" and "for that purpose it does
not matter what it may be called."

The view that, what the parties may name a transaction to be, or how they
describe its purpose, is not conclusive, was also shared by De Sampayo, J. in
Ponnamperuma v. Goonesekera (supra). In that case an uncle had conveyed
property to his niece, describing the transaction as a donatio mortis causa.
De Sampayo, J. at p. 238, however, observed that what the donor and his notary
meant in so naming the gift was "not apparent", and decided that it was
"obvious" that it was a gift inter vivos.

Whether the transaction in this case was a "gift" or not would depend on
whether the legal criteria for ascertaining whether there is s "gift" are
satisfied. A "gift" or, as it is sometimes called, a "donation", is,
technically, in its narrower sense, a giving or promising of a thing without
compulsion or legal obligation or stipulation for anything in return, freely,
out of sheer liberality or beneficence. (Voet, Commentarius ad

197

Pandectas, 39.5.1; Grotius, Inleidinge tot de Hollandsche Rechtsgerleedheid,
3.2.1.2; Van Leeuwen, Het Roomsch Hollandsche Recht, Vol. 2, p. 236 and
Censura Forensis, 1.4.12.1; Vander Linden, Rechtsgeleerd, Practicaal en
Koopmans Handboek, p. 213; Maasdorp, Institutes of South African Law, 8th Ed.
Vol. III, p. 52; Nathan, The Common Law of South Africa, Vol. 1, 2nd Ed. p.
1153 and p. 1163). The relevant question is: What was the donor's intention or
primary motive? (Windscheid (op. cit)).. In the case of a gift, the intention
or primary motive should be the enrichment of the donee, for the sake of
enrichment. Savigny (System des heutingen romischen Rechts, Vol. 4 paragraph
142) points out that an essential element of a donation is the disinterested
voluntas on the part of the giver who must be moved solely by the utilitas or
commodum of the receiver, and not his own advantage. The crucial test is
whether the donor was moved or induced to give his property simply by the
desire to enrich the donee; whether that which influenced. his volition, was
liberality. (See per Tindall, J.A., in Avis v. Verseput (20), citing Voet,
Commentarius ad Pandectas, Van Leeuwen, Censura Forensis, Ulirk Huber in
Praelectiones ad Inst. 2.6.4 and Heedensdaegsche Rechtsgeleertheyt). A motive
bestimmungstrund - for a gift may be one of several things; it may, for
instance, be vanity, publicity, the force of public opinion, duress, personal
advancement or some other selfish aim, or affection or charity. (See per
Watermeyer, A.C.J. in Avis v. Verseput (20), at p. 353, and at p. 382 per
Fischer, A.J.A. in the same case). A motive of this kind, it has been. said,
may explain the reasons for forming an intention to enrich someone else.
(Windscheid, Lehrbuch des Pandektenrechts, Vol. 2. paragraph 365). However, if
a transfer of property is to be regarded as a "gift" the person to whom
something is given must be given that thing with the intention of enriching
the donee, for enrichment's sake, whatever the remote, explanatory purposes
lurking in the background for doing so may be. (Windscheid,op.cit;J. E.
Goudsmit, Pandekten-systeem, Vol. 1 paragraph 68; Avis v. Verseput, supra, at
pp. 382-383 per Fischer, A.J. A.). 1 do not wish to enter into the difficult,
albeit interesting, philosophical debate on "intention v. motive". I believe
the requisite state of mind for deciding whether there was a gift in this case
is clear enough.

The question for us is this: Was the transfer of Apaladeniya Estate simply
made to enrich the respondent and her prospective bridegroom for the sake of
enriching them, so that it might be assumed that the

198

property was unconditionally, unalterably and irreversibly given and, as it
were abandoned, and put beyond hope of being ever called, or taken back or
recovered by undoing and revoking the transaction? Voet says (xxxix.5.5) that
"to donate is nothing else than to sacrifice and to abandon" (donare veto
nihil aliud est, quam jactare & perdere) and he says (xxxix.5.3) that when
something is given as a gift, it is given so that "in no event is it to come
back to himself". (Nullo cause ad se reverti) Cf. also Heen Banda v. Sinniah
(21). Or was the true purpose, was the primary motive or intention, in
transferring Apaladeniya Estate to induce, prompt and bring about the
marriage? Was the property given because of the promise of marriage or on
condition that the marriage took place - so that the donor could, with
justification, have "changed his mind" (Voet xxxix. 5.22. and xxxix. 5.35) and
taken steps to reverse, put an end to, undo, and revoke the transaction, if
the marriage did not take place?

Although a gift, in the narrow, technical and "proper" sense, had to be an act
of pure liberality, certain types of transactions which were moved or induced
by other considerations, such as a conveyance on account of marriage (donatio
propter nuptias) or in connection with a betrothal (sponsalita largitas) were,
nevertheless, called gifts. Judges and jurists, no less than the man in the
street, have, over a long period of time, described dowries and conveyances on
the occasion of marriage as "gifts". Although in Ponnamperuma (supra) De
Sampayo, J. distinguished between a gift and a donatio propter nuptias, yet in
Veeravagu (supra) His Lordship at p. 68 said that "A dowry, though it may be
given in consideration of marriage, is nevertheless a gift." On the other
hand, Hutchinson, C.J. in Jayasekera v. Wanigaratna (supra) at pp. 365-366
observed the distinction between a "pure gift" and a ' dowry'. (I have, later
on, more fully quoted the statement of Hutchinson, C.J.). Because the word
donatio, in the Roman and Roman-Dutch law, was used both in a narrow,
technical, sense and in a wide, popular, sense, it became necessary to attach
qualifying words and phrases to distinguish between the ways in which the term
donatio was used to ensure that the special rules applicable to "gifts", in
the narrower, technical, sense, would be applied in appropriate cases. Some
writers (e.g. see Mackeldey, Systema Juris Romani, pars. 466) distinguish
between a pure act of generosity (donatio mera) and one that is prompted

199

by the performance of something by the donee (donatio non mera). Huber (Hed.
Rechts. 111.14) seems to have taken a similar view. He distinguished between
donations arising from liberality, pure and simple, which were described as
eygentlyke - genuine - on the one hand, and quasi - donations \- oneygentiyke
- arising from some inducing reason (die om bewegende reeden geschiedt), on
the other. Gifts to encourage and promote marriage (voorzetten van houwelyk)
were regarded by Huber as quasi-donations.

Although Voet seems to have had some difficulty with regard to gifts made in
recompense of benefits or services which a donor neither was, nor believed
himself, legally bound to remunerate - donatio remuneratoria -, Voet (xxxix.
5.3) entertained no doubt that conveyances made on account of marriage, or in
connection with a betrothal, when they are called "gifts", are "improperly so
called" \- impropriae; and he distinguished them from a "sheer donation"
between betrothed persons - distincta omnino a simplici inter sponsum &
sponsam donatione. We are not concerned with remuneratory gifts in this case,
and fortunately so, for the authorities were hopelessly divided on whether
remuneratory gifts were technically qualified to be treated as donations or
not. Earlier (xxxix. 5.1). Voet distinguished between a gift (donum) and a
duty-gift (menus). A gift, he said, is the name given to a

"thing furnished of one's accord without any need of right or duty, and as to
which there is no blame if they are not furnished, while some praise generally
goes with them if they are furnished. But a duty-gift is properly one which we
undertake of need, by law or custom or at the command of one who has the power
to give such a direction. Instances are a birthday present and a wedding
present."

It is for the party seeking the assistance of a court for the revocation of a
gift, "properly so called", to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the
transfer of the property was a pure act of disinterested benevolence and
liberality. (See _Timoney and King v. King_ (22), _Birrell v. Weddell_ (23),
_Sakir v. Sakir_ (24), _Peters v.. Peters_ (25), _Smith's Trustees v. Smith_
(26), Avis v. Verseput (supra) at 345 and 377; _Ex parte Executors Estate
Everard_ (27), _Kay v. Kay_ (32), (supra);

200

Maasdorp, op. cit. p. 601. Voet (xxxix. 5.5) says that "a donation is not
presumed in doubt so long as another inference can be drawn. Thus he who sets
it up, even by way of defence, ought to prove it, for the reason that no one
is believed to be readily willing to sacrifice what is his and to donate is
nothing else than to sacrifice and to abandon." A donation must be clearly and
distinctly proved and must not be presumed as long as some other construction
is possible. ( _Venter v. de Klerck_ (28) _Timoney and King v. King_ (22),
_Avis v. Verseput_ (20)). It cannot be gathered from loose expressions of a
desire to bestow a gift, but must be manifest from the acts and language of
the donor. ( _Van Reenen's Trustees v Versfeld and Others_ (29) Avis Verseput,
(supra); Voet 39.5.5; Grotius, 3.2.4; Maasdorp p. 54).

A determination of the question whether a transaction is a gift or not is
important for several reasons. A "gift", in the narrower, technical sense, and
therefore, as some jurists would say, a gift "properly so called", was,
generally, subject to compliance with certain formalities for its validity.
Since, inter alia, it was deemed to be desirable to restrain generous,
impulsive liberality of the moment (cf. _Coronel's Curator v. Estate Coronel_
(30), _Avis v. Verseput, (supra_ ), at p. 365), compliance with certain
formalities were insisted upon in the formation of a valid contract of
donation. This was expected to give the donor time for reflection, so as to
put him on his guard with regard to the prudence of depleting his assets, and
also to give him the opportunity of considering the propriety of adversely
affecting the interests of his heirs. Whether we should regard the gift in
this case as arising from pure liberality and, therefore, whether we should
regard it as being eygentlyke - "genuine' \- and classify it as a species of
donation "properly so called" (ad propriae donationis species), does not
matter with regard to the formalities relating to the making up of a valid
contract. The transaction in this case related to immovable property. As such,
it was a matter governed by the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. That it might
have been a donatio propter nuptias or not, makes no difference, (See _Noorul
Hatchika v Noor Hameen_ )(31) The transaction in the case before us, as we
have seen at the outset, was executed by a notary: It was, therefore, made in
compliance with our law on the subject. And so, the condition of a valid
contract that the requisite forms or modes of agreement (if any) should be
observed, was satisfied in this case.

201

Another consequence of deciding that a conveyance of property was a gift in
the narrower, technical sense, and therefore, "properly so called", was this:
Although a gift is generally irrevocable (Grotius, Inleidinge 3.2.16) Nathan,
(op. cit. 1163)), it is revocable (1) if the donee failed to give effect to a
direction as to its application (donatio sub modo); (2) on the ground of the
donee's ingratitude; or (3) if at the time of the gift the donor was
childless, but afterwards became the father of a legitimate child by birth or
legitimation. (R. W. Lee, Introduction to Roman Dutch Law, 5th Ed. 289). On
the other hand, conveyances that were not made out of pure liberality were
irrevocable, even if the donee was guilty of ingratitude or subsequently had
legitimate children. (See per Tindall, JA and Watermeyer, ACJ in Avis v.
Verseput (supra) followed with approval per Ramsbottom, _JA in Kay v. Kay_
(32). See also Heen Banda v. Sinniah (33). A conveyance propter nuptias, not
being an act of pure liberality, and, therefore, technically, in the narrower
sense, not being a "gift" (at any rate, not a "gift" properly so called), is
irrevocable on account of a donee's ingratitude or on account of the
appearance of progeny, by birth or legitimation. (Voet, xxxix. 5.25 and 34;
Lee, ibid.; Nathan, (op. cit. 1164).

Mr. Daluwatte argued that, in terms of the deed of conveyance, the recital of
the fact that a marriage had been arranged and was to take place shortly, in
the context of the statements in that deed that the donation was to "take
effect on the marriage", and that the donees were to have and to hold the
property "from the marriage of the donees", meant that the phrase "in
consideration of" the marriage of the donees necessarily implied that the
conveyance was in fact made in the discharge of a parental obligation to give
a dowry. This was, he submitted, the "valuable consideration" of the contract
of donation. It showed, he said, that there was "cause". In the circumstances,
the conveyance was not a mere act of liberality. It was not a pure gift that
was revocable, but a donatio propter nuptias which was a transaction for
"valuable consideration". The existence of "valuable consideration" meant
that, once the contemplated marriage had taken place, the transaction became
unalterable and irreversible. The donor could no longer change her mind. The
transaction could not be undone. It could not be revoked. The property was
beyond recall and recovery. A subsequent dissolution

202

of the marriage had no effect. It was of no avail. The related, but
distinguishable, concepts of "consideration", justa causa, "intention", and
"motive", it seems are, in one way or another, found in Mr. Daluwatte's
argument.

Mr. Daluwatte referred us to Holland's Jurisprudence in support of his
submissions. In that work, (1910, Eleventh Ed. pp. 285-286), in describing
contracts whose object is "alienation", Holland stated as follows:

An alienatory contract may be a mere act of liberality on one side, or each
party may intend by means of it to secure some advantage for himself. In the
former case it is a contract to give; in the latter, a contract to exchange...

. . . In Roman Law and the derived systems, ungrateful conduct on the part of
the beneficiary would be ground for a rescission of the gift ...

Gifts in contemplation of marriage, which is, in the language of English law,
a "valuable" consideration, are not considered to be mere liberalities. The
rules therefore which regulate the presents made to the husband by means of
the Roman dosand the presents made to the wife by means of an English
jointure, or marriage settlement, are not those which would regulate merely
"voluntary" agreements.

The English concept of "consideration" may be relevant in considering certain
contracts, such as transactions relating to the sale of goods ( _Attorney-
General v. Abraham saibo_ (34), or in construing certain statutes such as the
Registration of Documents Ordinance - e.g., see _Salaman v. Obias_ (35) and
the Stamps Ordinance \- e.g., see Waharaka Investment _Co. Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Stamps_ (36), see also Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts, at
pp. 44-48 and 200-221). However, there is no dispute that in the matter before
us, the applicable rules are those of the Roman Dutch Law - what Holland
called a "derived system" from the Roman Law - and not the English Law; and,
therefore, the question whether there was "valuable consideration" in order to
make, and which made, the

203

 contract valid and enforceable, is, strictly speaking, irrelevant for our
purposes. Indeed, according to Holland (op. cit. 280, citing _Lipton v.
Buchanan_ (37), what we required in "Ceylon" (as Sri Lanka was then known) was
supposed to be no more than this: that an agreement, in order to be binding,
should be founded on a redelijke oorzaak, a causa legitima - some reasonable
and permissible ground for the consent of the parties. Voet (2.14.9) said that
a promise would be binding if it had been given serio et deliberatio animo.
The usefulness at all of the concept of causa in our law, in respect of
contracts governed by the Roman-Dutch Law, has been seriously doubted. (E.g.
R. W. Lee, Introduction to Roman Dutch Law at p. 224 and Appendix F;
Weeramantry (op. cit. at pp. 254-265). In any event, in our law relating to
contracts of the kind before us, causa is not the equivalent of "valuable
consideration". It is not a quid pro quo. In general, what is required is that
a promise should be seriously and deliberately made. The view that, for the
validity of transactions to which the Roman-Dutch Law is applicable, the
English law requirement of "valuable consideration" is unnecessary, despite
some earlier erroneous decisions (e.g. see D.C. Colombo 53 775 (1871) Vander
Straaten 192; C.R. Negombo 33605, (1889) 3 SCC 70), has been consistently
recognised by our Courts before and after Lipton (37), (cited by Holland and
affirmed in review in 10 NLR 158). _E.g. See Muttu Carpen Chetty v. Capper_
(38); _Jayawickrema v. Amarasuriya_ (39) ; _Abeysekera v. Gunasekera_ (40);
_Edward v de Silva_ (41); following _Conradie v. Rossouw_ (42); _Public
Trustee v. Udurawana_ (43). One might, in the circumstances, be pardoned for
being somewhat surprised that we see again in this case, to which the English
Law has no application, what _Lord Dunedin, in Dunlop v. Selfridge_ (44),
described as, a "budding affection . . . for the doctrine of consideration."

In any event, it must be understood that whether the words used in a deed
indicate the existence of "valuable consideration" or not, depends on the
construction to be properly placed on that, particular, deed. Thus in
Kanapathipillai v. Subramaniam (45) where a father had gifted two lands to his
son for and in consideration of love and affection", the fact that the deed
went on to state that the transfer was subject to the son discharging a debt
owed by the donor did not mean that it was a transfer for "valuable
consideration". Sansoni, J.

204

(H. N. G. Fernando, J. agreeing) held at p. 463 that, although the donor would
undoubtedly benefit to a certain extent, yet the transfer was for "the
consideration recited in the deed", namely, "love and affection", and not "a
transfer for valuable consideration." I have already explained that in form,
the deed in the case before us was a gift and, therefore, the conveyance was
ex facie an act of liberality and not motivated by "valuable consideration".
Whether, having regard to its terms, it was also in substance a gift, is a
matter I shall refer to later on.

Mr. Daluwatte suggested that the giving of a dowry was a discharge of a 'duty'
on the part of the donor and that the discharge of that 'duty' was the
"valuable consideration" in the contract of donation before us. Possibly, in
certain circumstances, in Roman Law, a father might have been compelled, even
against his wish, to give a dowry to his daughter. (See D. xxiii. 2.19; Voet
23.3.8). I know of no such legal duty on a parent today in Sri Lanka.
Moreover, the discharge of a legal duty cannot be properly regarded as
"valuable consideration". (E.g. _See Collins v. Godefroy_ (46); _England v.
Davidson_ (47); _Ward v. Byham_ (48); _Williams v. Williams_ (49); A. L.
Goodhart, Performance of an Existing duty as Consideration, 72 LQR 490;
Weeramantry, op. cit. p. 231).

If Mr. Daluwatte meant to suggest that the promise to convey Apaladeniya
Estate was in pursuance of the donor's moral obligations, that too would not
be "valuable consideration", for moral consideration is not 'valuable
consideration". (E.g. see _Latchime v. Jamison_ (50) ). In fact, as Lord
Wright has pointed out (Ought the Doctrine of Consideration be abc ished from
the Common Law?, (1936) 49 Harvard Law Review 1225 at p. 1235), they are
contradictory notions. The conveyance in this case may not have been a donum,
but rather a munus a duty-gift. (See Voet xxxix. 5; Avis v. Versepu(20) ;
Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Estate & eenarce (51) , at 231). But that is
another matter.

If we should at all be inquiring into the matter from the point of view of
"valuable consideration", as Mr. Daluwatte seems to suggest we should, ought
we then not to be asking ourselves What was the consideration moving from the
donee in return for the gift ? (cf. Weeramantry, op. cit. p. 236 et seq.);
What was the quid pro quo for Apaladeniya Estate?; rather than asking
ourselves: What was the consideration moving from the donor ? Although the
existence of

205

"valuable consideration" is not essential for the validity of the contract
before us, ascertaining whether the donor transferred the property on account
of something promised or performed in return, would, I think, clarify the
donor's intention and help us decide whether the conveyance was or was not in
substance the pure act of liberality it appears to be in form. Was it the
marriage or promise of marriage on the part of the donee that led the donor to
transfer Apaladeniya Estate? Was the marriage the consideration for, - in the
sense of the quid pro quo, the reason for, that which brought about, a
condition precedent to, - the transfer? And, in turn, was the transfer the
consideration for,- in the sense of the quid pro quo, the reason for, that
which brought about, a condition precedent to - the marriage? (Cf. _Jayasekera
v. Wanigaratna_ (17) ).

Mr. Daluwatte submitted that the gift was given to the donees to enable them
to shoulder the burdens of marriage, and, therefore, the transaction was a
donatio propter nuptias. Voet (xxxix. 5.25) followed by analogy in _Pillans v
Porter's Executors_ (52) . See also _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Estate
Greenacre_ (51) , said that a dowry or donation propter nuptias is
"improperly" called a gift, since an "onerous" rather than "lucrative" title
is given for the "shouldering of the burdens of marriage'. to a prospective
bridegroom who would otherwise not have been likely to "take to wife an
undowered woman".

Easing the burdens of a child's marriage may be a desirable and commendable
purpose. However, doing something about it, may or may not be an act of pure
liberality. If, a conveyance of property is made as an incentive to take on
the responsibilities of marriage by easing its financial burdens, which the
parties may otherwise be unable, or find difficult, to bear, it might,
perhaps, in the light of such explanatory circumstances, be more easily
regarded as a donatio propter nuptias, rather than as a pure gift - an act of
mere generosity and liberality. Yet, in the end, if the transaction is said to
be a donatio propter nuptias, it must be established by sufficient evidence
that the donor made the gift because the marriage, in-terms of the donee's
promise, would take place. A transfer donatio nuptias is not absolute and
unqualified. It is conditional. The gift is propter nuptias because

206

there is the promise of marriage or marriage by the donee in return for the
gift. The "consideration for" the gift is the promise of marriage or marriage
by the donee.

And so, a donatio propter nuptias is, in one sense, made in consideration of
marriage in that the transfer made is having regard to the fact that a
marriage shall be entered into. The property is given because, in the sense
that in order or so that, the marriage shall take place. It is the reason why
the marriage takes place. It is that which brings about the promise of
marriage or the wedding. The property is given, more or less, as something
akin to a payment, something given in exchange, a quid pro quo, or reward or
compensation. The transfer is prompted by the promise or performance of
something by the donee, thereby making it a donatio non mera, and not a pure
act of liberality (donatio mera). In the case of a donatio propter nuptias,
the property may also be said to have been given in consideration of marriage,
but in the sense that it is given merely by reason of, or on account of, or
having regard to the fact or circumstance of, or motivated by, or on the
occasion of, the marriage. Perhaps the distinction between a donatio propter
nuptias and an ordinary gift given on the occasion of a marriage might become
somewhat clearer if I might say this: People do not marry because of the
wedding presents - the gifts - they might receive; nor are wedding presents
given to bring about the marriage. A wedding present is a pure act of
liberality, unconditionally given, without any sense of compulsion or
obligation, with no hope of recall or recovery if the marriage does not take
place. A donatio propter nuptias is not.

There are some reported decisions of our Courts that support the view that a
conveyance in consideration of marriage is not an act of pure liberality. The
reasoning appears to be this: where something is given because the recipient
has promised to marry or married, because the transfer is prompted, or brought
about by the fact that the promise of marriage would not otherwise be given or
the marriage would not otherwise take place, the transfer is not a pure act of
liberality.

In _Theodoris Fernando v. Rosalin Fernando_ (53) , a father had agreed with
his intended son-in-law that, in consideration of his marriage with his
daughter, he would, at such marriage, make over and convey

207

certain lands to his daughter. The marriage took place, but the father died
before the marriage. The girl's mother, as executrix, conveyed the promised
properties. In deciding whether the conveyance was in fraud of creditors,
Lawrie, A.C.J. at p. 285 said-:

Certainly if a land be conveyed before marriage by a bridegroom to his bride
or to marriage settlement trustees, or if the parents of the bride convey land
to her and to the bridegroom or to the trustees in consideration of the
marriage, then the conveyance would be for valuable causes.

Moncrieff, J. appears to have shared the view that the gift given in that
case, in consideration of marriage was for valuable consideration, and,
therefore, could not be set aside. The views expressed by Lawrie, A.C.J. and
Moncrieff, J., however, were obiter, since the fact of insolvency was not
established.

_In Jayasekera v. Wanigaratna_ (17) , a father executed a deed in favour of
his daughter "on the day of her marriage as dowry". The question for decision
was whether that deed, being one for valuable consideration, gained priority
over an anterior deed by prior registration (in terms of the Registration of
Documents Ordinance, which incorporated English rules and let in English
concepts in its construction, cf. Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts, at p. 50)
Hutchinson, CJ. at pp. 365-366 said

**"... . a conveyance of land by a father to, or for the benefit of, his
daughter by way of dowry on her marriage is prima facie, a conveyance for
valuable consideration. **It is possible, of course, and it is a thing which
is done every day, for the parents or friends of a bride to give her a present
on the day of her marriage, a pure gift, which does not form the consideration
or any part of the consideration for the bridegroom marrying her. But that is
not dowry. And in this country, as in most others, the dowry is almost always
the consideration or part of the consideration for the man taking the woman as
his wife. **The fact of the deed being called a "deed of gift" cannot make any
difference, if it is clearly proved what the real nature of it was."**

**208**

The emphasis is mine.

The circumstances must be considered in deciding whether a conveyance was on
the one hand, an act of sheer liberality, whether it was as Hutchinson, C.J.
said, "a present on the day of her marriage, a pure gift which does not form
the consideration or any part of the consideration for the bridegroom marrying
her", or, on the other, whether it was a gift in consideration of marriage, in
the sense that it was a transaction prompted by, or as Voet says (xxxix.
5.34), entered into "so that a suitor or a girl might be tempted to a marriage
which would not have ensued at all" . . ut ad matrimonium, alioquin haud
secuturum, procus aut paella invitaretur . . . Was the transfer of Apaladeniya
Estate, as De Sampayo, J. said in Ponnamperuma (supra) an "inducement" for the
marriage? Was it an inducing reason - die om bewegende reeden geschiedt - as
Huber (ibid.) might have put it ? Was the transfer that which made marriage
attractive and led the respondent on to take Perera's hand in marriage? Was
the gift a condition of the marriage? Could it be said that the marriage would
not have "ensued at all" but for the transfer? What was the understanding?

A Court cannot profess to be able to divine what was in a donor's mind. That
is an inference to be drawn on a balance of probabilities from the proved
facts. (Cf. per Tindall, JA, in Avis v. Verseput, (supra) at p. 366). If, as
Mr. Daluwatte submits, and if as the Court of Appeal concluded, the conveyance
was a donatio propter nuptias, there must be admissible evidence from which it
might be deduced that the conveyance was made to encourage or promote the
marriage - voorzetten van howelyk -, that it was to "tempt' the marriage, from
which circumstances it might be inferred that it was on account of the promise
of marriage, or that it was on the condition of the marriage taking place,
that the transfer was made. There must be evidence from which it could be
concluded that the transfer was prompted or "brought about" by the marriage or
the promise of marriage. Ex facie, as a matter of form, the conveyance, as we
have seen, was a gift. However, if, as Mr Daluwatte urged, it was in substance
a donatio propter nuptias, in that the conveyance was prompted and brought
about by the promise, or the fact, of the marriage taking place and,
therefore, it was a donatio non mera, and,

209

consequently, a transaction arising from some inducing reason - die om
bewegende reeden geschiedt - because it was given to encourage and promote the
marriage - voorzetten van houwelyk - by helping, as Mr. Daluwatte explained,
to relieve its burdens, and, therefore, it was not a "gift" in the narrower,
technical sense, - eygentlyke - a "genuine", "properly so called", gift - but
rather a quasi \- donation - oneygentlyke -, "gift" improperly so called -
donatio impropria -, there must be admissible evidence leading the Court to
such a conclusion. The deed does not say, to use the words of Middleton, J. in
_Obeysekera Hamine et al. v. Jayatilleke Hamine_ (54), "that if the promisee
will marry [Perera] or someone else that the properties will be conveyed".

Mr. Samarasekera complained that, since the question of revocability on the
ground that the transaction had been a donatio propter nuptias had been raised
for the first time in the Court of Appeal, he did not have the opportunity of
showing that the transaction was not a donatio propter nuptias. As we have
seen, the onus of showing that the transaction was a gift is on the person who
seeks to revoke it. Yet, where, as in the case before us, the terms of the
deed, ex facie, show that it was a gift, in my view, the burden of adducing
evidence to show that it was in fact, in substance, in reality, a donatio
propter nuptias, is on the person who claims that it was a special kind of
gift. De Sampayo, J. observed in Ponnamperuma, (supra) that "the nature of the
gift, if it is to be claimed as being of a special kind, should be disclosed
in the instrument itself". If, as His Lordship seemed, however, to have been
prepared to consider, there was extrinsic evidence to the contrary, it should,
as His Lordship said in that case, not fall "short of what is necessary." If
the donee's position was that, although ex facie the deed was a deed of gift,
it was in fact a donatio nuptias, a gift of a "special kind", as De Sampayo,
J. put it, obviously, it was not for Mr Samarasekera's client, the donor-
appellant, but for Mr. Daluwatte's client, the donee-respondent, to show that
she took Perera's hand in marriage because her parents transferred Apaladeniya
Estate in return for her doing so. If I might use the words of Middleton, J.
in Obeysekera Hamine (supra), "she has not gone into the box to prove that".

In _Obeysekera Hamine et al. v. Jayatilleke Hamine_ (54), the stepdaughter of
the defendant, (the first plaintiff), and the husband of the

**210 **

step-daughter, (the second plaintiff), sued the defendant for the specific
performance of an agreement signed by the defendant by which she undertook,
after she had taken out letters of administration to her deceased husband's
estate, to convey to the step-daughter, by way of dowry, certain specified
properties of her deceased husband, on "the joyful occasion of her marriage."
Grenier, J. (at p. 164) said

"It was argued that the promise as embodied in the agreement was a nudum
pactum, and cannot therefore be enforced. It is unnecessary to deal with this
large question on this appeal, because I think that the agreement simply
amounted to a declaration, and nothing more, that the defendant would at some
future time give certain lands to the 1st plaintiff by way of dowry out of
property belonging to her deceased father's estate. I am inclined to take the
view put forward by Counsel for the appellant that the object with which this
document was drawn out was to show that the 1st plaintiff would not be
dowerless, but that after the defendant had duly administered her husband' s
estate she would convey to the 1st plaintiff certain lands out of that estate.
The 2nd plaintiff was no party to this agreement, and it cannot be said that
he was induced to marry the 1st plaintiff in the belief that the defendant
would convey certain lands to his wife in consideration of his marrying her."

Middleton, J. at p. 165 said

"The consideration or rather justa causa in Roman-Dutch Law 8 NLR p. 49 if any
must proceed from the promisee, the first plaintiff. Leake on Contracts p. 480
(4 ed). She has not gone into the box to prove that she married the second
plaintiff because the document A, was signed by her stepmother:

In my view therefore no justa causa proceeding from the promisee has been
proved which would make this a valid agreement for the breach of which id quod
interest or damages might be exacted. The document promises to convey the
various properties as dowry by reason of the joyful occasion of the promisee's
marriage.

211

It does not promise that if the promisee will marry the second plaintiff or
someone else that the properties will be conveyed.

For this reason I am inclined to the view that the defendant cannot be made
liable in damages."

And so, it is the donee, and not the donor, who might have been prejudiced, if
at all, by the lack of extrinsic evidence in the matter before us, assuming,
of course, that such evidence was admissible. The Court of Appeal did not
resort to extrinsic evidence in concluding that the transfer was a donatio
propter nuptias and Mr. Daluwatte, who appeared for the donee, insists that
such evidence is inadmissible.

Mr. Samarasekera drew our attention to the fact that the prospective son-in-
law, Perera, had not contested the revocation. It was he, who might have been
induced to marry. His failure to resist the action for revocation was, Mr.
Samarasekera said, indicative of the fact that the gift was not induced by the
promise of marriage. The fact that the transfer of the property was induced or
prompted by the marriage is no doubt important in deciding whether it was a
donatio propter nuptias. However, I do not agree that the disinterest of the
prospective son-in-law concludes the matter in the case before us. The dictum
of de Sampayo J. in Ponnamperuma v. Goonesekera (supra) that, because the gift
in that case was not to the prospective bridegroom but to his wife, "one
element of this kind of donation is absent", does not assist the appellant in
the case before us. Nor does the observation of Grenier, J. in Obeysekera
Hamine (supra) that, since the second plaintiff in that case was no party to
the agreement, it could not be said that he was induced by the gift to marry
the first plaintiff. The transfer in the case before us was not to the
prospective son-in-law alone, but to both the daughter and prospective son-in-
law of the donor. I agree with Mr. Daluwatte that, the inducement may well
have been offered to both parties. Certainly, an incentive may be offered to
the man or to the girl. (Cf Voet, 34.5.34 - vide supra). And there is nothing
to prevent it from being offered to both of them. Shouldering the burdens of
marriage might well have been seen as a shared responsibility of both the
daughter and her husband. Or was it an inducement offered to the appellant-
daughter alone? It has not

212

 been established that the respondent - the daughter - was induced by the gift
of Apaladeniya Estate, because it might have ensured her ability, as Mr.
Daluwatte suggested, to "shoulder the burdens of marriage". Perhaps, the
respondent was reluctant to marry Perera because she feared she might cease to
live in her accustomed comfortable circumstances? Did the respondent agree to
marry Perera because the transfer of Apaladeniya Estate would sufficiently
meet her requirement that she should continue to live in comfort? But then,
was the prospective bridegroom impecunious, or at least unable to support his
wife in the life-style she was accustomed to? Or was the property transferred,
as it was in _Wijetunga v. Atapattu_ (55), merely to "win over" one or both of
the donees? There was no evidence on such matters either in the deed or in
other part of the record before the Court of Appeal. What were the
circumstances from which the Court inferred that it was the promise of
marriage or the marriage - the donee's consideration - that moved the
appellant to make the gift? What was the basis upon which the Court of Appeal
might have properly concluded that the conveyance was a gift propter nuptias?

As we have seen, having regard to certain words and phrases used, ex facie,
the deed appears to be a deed of gift. We might . further consider its terms
to ascertain whether it was a donatio propter nuptias. The deed states that a
marriage had been arranged and that it was to take place shortly and that the
donors had decided to "donate" the property "on the occasion of and in
consideration of the marriage."

According to the deed, the subject-matter of the transaction was a valuable
land. Therefore, unlike ordinary wedding presents, or gifts of flowers and
consumables and the like given by betrothed persons to each other, it cannot
be assumed that the transfer was intended as an absolute, pure, act of
liberality, where the thing given was more or less abandoned with no hope of
recovery if the marriage did not take place. (See Voet xxxix. 5.3 and 5. Cf.
_Heen Banda v. Chinniah_ (21)).

On the other hand, the deed refers to the fact that it was a gift to their
"only child". Does this not suggest that the act was one of liberality rather
than one moved and prompted by other considerations?

213

However, the gift was not to take effect immediately. It was to "take effect
on the marriage of the donees" and they were to have the property "for ever",
but "from the marriage". This would suggest that the transfer was conditional
upon the marriage. Moreover the transfer was subject to the life interest of
the parent - donors. Ordinarily, a donatio propria, a gift properly so called,
is made with the intention that the thing gifted shall at once become the
property-of the recipient. (Voet 39.5.4; Maasdorp, p. 53; Nathan p. 1155).

But then, if, as Mr. Daluwatte argued, the motive of the donor was to induce
the marriage by lightening its burdens, and that it should, therefore, be
inferred that the change of civil status was the consideration for the gift,
why did the appellant-donor make the gift subject to a life interest for
herself and her co-donor husband? Admittedly, the gift was to "take effect on
the marriage" and "from the marriage", but this merely meant that the title to
Apaladeniya Estate was vested on the marriage taking place. The transfer was
subject to a life interest. The enjoyment of the property was postponed. It
was a case of dies cedit sed non venit. How could the marriage be made
attractive by a reduction of its burdens when the right to enjoy the property
and take its fruits, when the right to remain in full and undisturbed
possession and enjoy the produce and profits of the Estate, remained, even
after the marriage, exclusively and undisturbed in the donors who had reserved
to themselves a life interest - an interest, incidentally, which the
appellant-donor yet enjoys, many years after the occasion of the marriage? The
reservation of a life interest showed that the conveyance was not propter
nuptias.

In terms of the deed before us, I am of the view that the conveyance was a
present, albeit a valuable gift, by parents to their only child, simply to
enrich her for the sake of enrichment, having regard to the fact that she was
getting married, that is to say in consideration of her marriage, taking into
account the fact that, in the words of the donor in Obeysekera Hamine, "the
joyful occasion of her marriage" was an appropriate event for giving a
present. It was given as an act of liberality. However the generous parents
did not act impulsively and recklessly without sufficient regard for their own
situation and, therefore, the gift was made subject to a life interest.

214

Having regard to its extraordinarily valuable nature, it was somewhat
different from an ordinary wedding present. But like all other wedding
presents, customarily given, it was not something given to induce or prompt or
bring about the marriage. (Cf. per De Sampayo; J. in Ponnamperuma (supra). The
donor was not moved to give the gift by the promise of marriage or by the act
of marriage. (Cf. Wijetunge v. Attapattu (supra) ). It was not given to
requite or recompense. It was not a part of a bargain or a sort of exchange.
Looking at it from the donee's point of view, the transfer of the property was
not a condition of the marriage. It did not form the consideration or part of
the consideration, in the sense of an inducement or a quid pro quo, for the
parties getting married. (Cf. per Middleton, J. in Obeysekera Hamine; per
Hutchinson C.J. in Jayasekera (supra); Cf. also _Kanapathipillai v.
Subramaniam_ (45)). As such, it was a gift pure and simple - a gift properly
so called. To use De Sampayo's words in Ponnamperuma (supra), "both in form
and substance it is an ordinary gift"; and, therefore, it is revocable on the
ground of ingratitude. In my view, on the material before it, the Court of
Appeal could not have properly concluded that the conveyance was, to use the
words of De Sampayo, J. in Ponnamperuma (supra) " a donation propter nuptias
in the true sense of the expression"; and, therefore, for the reasons I have
explained, it should not have been decided that the deed was irrevocable,
despite proof of the donee's ingratitude.

Assuming, arguendo, that there was a donatio propter nuptias, what was the
effect of the dissolution of the marriage? The Court of Appeal did not
consider this aspect of the matter, but, following Professor Lee's statement
of the law (op. cit. p. 289) that revocation was not possible in the case of a
"marriage settlement", inter alia, on the ground of ingratitude, it held that
the gift in this case was irrevocable.

Professor Lee based his view on Voet 39.5.25 and 34 and on Avis v. Verseput
(supra). Avis v. Verseput was not concerned with a donatio propter nuptias :
It was a case relating to the subject of remuneratory donations. As far as the
passages in Voet (upon which he based his conclusions) are concerned,
Professor Lee overlooked the fact that Voet dealt with gifts in the event of
the dissolution of marriage on an exceptional basis. Voet regarded a dowry or
a

215

donatio propter nuptias as a gift "improperly so called", and said that, like
a remuneratory gift, a dowry or a donatio propter nuptias, must be reckoned
"rather as onerous than as lucrative titles, since they are given for
shouldering the burdens of marriage, and the man would not have been likely to
take to wife an undowered woman", (non etiam revocationi donatorum locus est
ob causam ingratitudinis, quoties donatio remuneratoria facta fuit ... Nes
aliud statutendum de dote aut propter nuptias donatione; cum & hae minus
propriae donationes sint, magisque onerosis quam lucrativus titulis
accenseantur, indotam ducturus non fuisset; sive a patre sive ab extraneo dos
data fit). However, Voet then qualified what he said. He said:

Si tamen soluto matrimonio dos aut propter nuptias donatio ad ingratam aut
ingratum reversa fit, magis est, ut tunc actione hac revocataria recte
conveniatur, quippe jam magis ex lucrativa quam onerosa causa possidens id,
quod stante matrimonio dotale fuerat. Nevertheless if a dowry or donation on
account of marriage has gone back to an ungrateful man or woman on dissolution
of the marriage, the position is rather that he or she is then correctly sued
in this revocatory action, inasmuch as he or she now possesses on a lucrative
rather than on an onerous cause something which was dotal while the marriage
lasted. (cane, Vol. 6 p. 117).

Thereafter, Voet goes on to explain why the written answer of the Emperors,
appearing in the Code (V.12.24), concerning a gift by a patron to the husband
of his freedwoman, is not at variance with this view. Later (xxxix. 5.34),
Voet affirms the position that a dos or donatio propter nuptias is not
revocable for ingratitude except if the marriage has been dissolved and the
property has gone back to the person in whose favour it. has been given, for
then it is understood to be in his or her hands, not on an onerous basis, but
on the basis of a lucrative title. Voet said:

"Et quod ante de dote vel propter nuptias donatione ob ingratitudinem
revocanda vel non revocanda dictum num. 25. id simili modo in hac quaestione
de revocando propter liberos postea susceptos recipiendum est, revocationi
scilicet locum

216

non esse, nisi postquam dos aut propter nuptias donatio soluto matrimonio ad
conjugem, cujus contemplatione a tertio data erat, reversa fuerit, ut
intelligatur non ex oneroso sed lucrativo titulo jam penes eum eamve esse.
What has been said above in section 25 as to a dowry or donation on account of
marriage being revocable or not revocable for ingratitude must be accepted in
like manner on this question of revoking on account of children being raised
up afterwards. That is to say there is no room for revocation except after a
dowry or donation on account of marriage has gone back on dissolution of the
marriage to the spouse with reference to whom it has been given by a third
party, so that it is understood to be now in his or her hands not on an
onerous but on a lucrative title." (Gane, Vol. 6 p. 127).

In discussing the thorny question of the need for registration as a condition
of the validity of a transaction, (which, as we have seen does not concern us
on account of the applicability of the provisions of the Prevention of Frauds
Ordinance to this case), Voet distinguishes between remuneratory gifts, on the
one hand, and a donation propter nuptias, on the other. He said (xxxix. 5.17):
"Remuneratory donations are irrevocable, but this donation on account of
marriage is revocable, and is liable to have to be returned when the marriage
is dissolved. It therefore seemed good that the need to register it should be
laid upon the husband in the interest of the woman, so that it might be clear
and could be proved what and how much had been donated and must be given back
"if perchance the original documents should be lost, as may easily happen,"
according to the words of the Emperor . . . " (Gane, Vol. 6, p. 107).

dum donationes remuneratoriae irrevocabiles sunt, haec vero propter nuptias
revocabilis & matrimonio socuto obnoxia restitutioni; ut proinde visum fuerit,
in gratiam mulieris imponi marito insinuationem ejus; quo appareret ac probari
posset, quid quantumque donatum ac reddendum fit. si forte, principalia
instrumenta pereant, quod facile est, ut ait imperator. . .

Voet, who, as Watermeyer, A CJ, observed in Avis v. Verseput, (supra), at p.
351 fin., "treats the subject of donation more fully than

217

 most of the other recognized Roman-Dutch authorities", makes it quite clear
that the dissolution of a marriage alters the character of a dotal gift, the
donee after the dissolution having a "lucrative" rather than an "onerous"
title. The property is dotal in character stante matrimonio, while the
marriage lasts, but not thereafter. The principles that apply to a donatio
propter nuptias cease to be applicable when a marriage, in consideration of
which a gift was made, ceases to exist. The bottom of the transaction as it
were falls off.

Nathan (Common Law of South Africa), 2nd Ed., Vol. ii, p. 1164) does not cite
these passages from Voet, but states as follows

There can, according to Voet and Grotius, be no revocation on account of
ingratitude in the case of a donatio remuneratoria, which is more an exchange
than a gift. In the same way, says Voet, neither a dos nor a donatio propter
nuptias can be revoked (see _Pillans v. Porter's Executors_ (52)), on the
ground of ingratitude, by a parent or third party (extraneus); although he is
of opinion that on the termination of the marriage, when the dos or donatio
reverts to the spouse in whose favour it was given, the donor may claim it on
the ground of ingratitude.

Mr. Daluwatte argued that a dowry is given to lighten the burdens of marriage
and make it more attractive. However, then, if the marriage ceases to exist,
surely, the need to relieve its burdens does not continue? Would such a
situation, mutatis mutandis, not be analogous to a case where a marriage does
not take place at all, requiring the return of the things given propter
nuptias? (See _Appuhamy v. Mudalisamy_ (56); _John Sinno v. Weerawardene et
al_. (57); _Heenbanda v. Chinniah_ (21), _Wijetunge v. Atapattu_ (55); _Van
Duyn v. Visser_ (58); _Maasdorp p_.( 54).

I should also like to invite attention to certain observations of Gratiaen, J.
in Ratnayake v. Mary Nona (59). That was a case in which revocation was
sought, not on the basis of ingratitude, but on the basis of the legitimation
of a child of the donor after the making of the gift. A gift is revocable if
children are born or legitimated after the gift, because a gift is subject to
the tacit condition that the donor will be without progeny. Gratiaen, J. at p.

The "tacit condition" suggested by Voet as the theoretical explanation of a
revocatory action can, in a sense, be equated to a contractual resolutive
condition which, if subsequently fulfilled, invalidates the contract which was
valid at its inception (Voet, 18.5.1.). As Wessels explained in The Law of
Contract in South Africa, Vol. 1 p. 432 and p. 437, "a contract subject to a
resolutive and resolutory condition creates a legal bond between the parties,
but in such a way that if the condition is fulfilled, the legal bond is
broken, and the parties are restored as much as possible to their former
condition. By the fulfilment of the resolutive condition, the contract ceases
to exist."

But is there any need in the present context to discover some logical
explanation for the remedy which the Roman Dutch Law recognizes in revocatory
actions? As in the well-known "frustration" cases in commercial transactions,
some may explain the remedy by speaking of the disappearance of the assumed
foundation of the basis of the contract, others by reading an implied term
into the written instrument. _Constantine Steamship Line v. Imperial Smelting
Co_. (60). Lord Sumner would perhaps describe it as a device by which the
rules as to absolute contracts are reconciled with a special exception which
justice demands." _Hirji Mulji v.. Cheong Yue Steamship Co._ (61). Suffice it
to say in the words of Lord Simon that "whichever way it is put, the legal
consequence is the same."

The point does not arise in this case, but for the sake of completeness, and
to allay any misgivings, I should say` this: a property which is liable to be
returned upon an order for revocation on account of ingratitude, does not
include the fruits of the property up to the time of the joinder of issues
(Voet 34.5.25). Further, a property donated cannot be claimed for ingratitude
if the donee, in good faith and without any intention to defraud the donor,
had alienated the property by sale, donation, exchange, dowry or transfer on
account of any other lawful cause whatever. (Voet 34.5.24; _Horatala v.
Sanchi_ (62); _Manuelpillai v. Nallamma_ (63); at _Nathan (op. cit._ (60).

There is no doubt that if the conveyance in this case was either an ordinary
gift, in the first place, as I think it was, or assuming as the

219

Court of Appeal did that it was a donatio propter nuptias, then, since, as a
matter of law, it had to be regarded as an ordinary gift after the dissolution
of the marriage, it would in either case have been revocable for ingratitude.
(Voet xxxix. 5.22 read with xxxix. 5.17, 25 and 34).

Mr. Daluwatte, however, argued that the gift is not revocable because the
evidence did not support the allegation of assault and that there was no proof
of ingratitude. The learned District Judge was satisfied that the fact of
assault was proved and I see no reason to disagree with him. Mr. Daluwatte
submitted that if there was a single blow or a single incident, as in this
case, it was then a manifestation of "slight" ingratitude. I agree that slight
acts of ingratitude are insufficient for revocation. Voet xxxix. 5.22
explained it in this way:

Leviores plane ingratitudinis causae revocationi faciendae haud sufficiunt
licet enim & leges & rectaratio ominem omnino, utcunque leviorem,
ingratitudinis maculam vitumque damnent, non tamen ideo protinus earn
revocatione donati voluerunt mulctari. Tolerant scilicet legum latores
leviora, dum emendare nequeunt, ac satis praevident, fora omnis atque
tribunalia non suffectura actionibus adversus ingratos movendis, si quodlibet
ingratitudinis etiam levioris crimen severa foret lege vindicandum. Of course
slighter causes of ingratitude are by no means enough to bring about a
revocation. Although both the laws and right reason entirely condemn every
blot and blemish of ingratitude, albeit somewhat slight, nevertheless they
have not intended that for that reason it should be forthwith penalized by
revocation of the gift. I mean that the framers of the laws put up with
slighter things, since they cannot better them, and they foresee quite clearly
that all courts and benches would not be enough for the starting of actions
against ungrateful persons, if every offence of ingratitude even of slighter
kind had to be punished by a stern law. - Gane, Vol. 6 p. 114.

What amounts to an act of ingratitude, sufficient to warrant revocation, must
vary with the circumstances of each case. For example, in _Sansoni v.
Foenander_ (64), revocation was granted on account of the non-fulfilment of a
condition, and for atrocious and

220

 calumnious slander by the donee-nephew of his donor-aunt. In _Hamine v.
Gunawardene_ (65), the donee-son calling the donor-mother a "whore" during a
quarrel, under provocation, was held to be insufficient for revocation. In
_Sinnacuddy v. Vethattai_ (66), the elopement of the donee with a low caste
man was held to be insufficient. In _Sivarasapillai v. Anthonypillai_ (67),
the donor-wife was driven out of the house given to the donee-husband by
reason of her "nomadic habits" leading to a "cat and dog life". It was held to
be not sufficient. However, the laying of personally violent, impious, wicked,
sacrilegious hands (judges and jurists translate manus impias in these, and
perhaps other, different ways) on the donor is, without question one of the
five specified causes of ingratitude warranting "just" revocation. A donor is
entitled to revoke a donation on account of ingratitude (1) if the donee lays
manus impias on the donor; (2) if he does him an atrocious injury; (3) if he
wilfully causes him great loss of property; (4) if he makes an attempt upon
his life; (5) if he does not fulfil the conditions attached to the gift. In
addition, a gift may be revoked for other, equally grave, causes.
_(Manuelpillai v. Nallamma_ (63); Voet 39.5.22; Van Leeuwen, Censura Farensis,
xxxix. 5.22 and Het Roomsch Hollandsche Recht, (Kotze Vol. 2 pp. 235236;
Huber, Heedensdaegsche Rechtsgeleertheyt, (Gave) Vol. 1 p. 477; Grotius,
Inleidinge; 111.2.16 and 17; Burge, Commentaries on Colonial and Foreign Laws,
(1838), Vol 2. p. 146; Domat, Les Loix civiles dans leur ordre naturel, Vol 1,
p. 406 ; Maasdorp, op. cit. p. 60. These acts are regarded as so serious, that
a gift is revocable on account of such manifestations of ingratitude, even
though the donor may have expressly agreed on oath not to exercise his power
of revocation. (Voet xxxix. 5.22. See also Perezius, Praelectiones Codicis
Justiniani, viii. Ivi.4.7; _Krishnaswamy v. Thillaiyambalam_ (68)).

As for the argument, that there was but a single blow, or a single act of
ingratitude, I think the answer was, with great respect, sufficiently given by
Basnayake, C.J. in Krishnaswamy (supra) at p. 269 when he said

"The ways in which a donee may show that he is ungrateful being legion, it is
not possible to state what is "slight ingratitude" and what is not, except in
regard to the facts of a given case. There is nothing in the books which lays
down the

221

rule that a revocation may not be granted on the commission of a single act of
ingratitude. Ingratitude is a form of mind which has to be inferred from the
donee's conduct. Such an attitude of mind will be indicated either by a single
act or by a series of acts."

I have no doubt that the donee-daughter, by assaulting her donorparents, was
guilty of what Voet (xxxix. 5.35) referred to as "the foul offence of
ingratitude". I am of the view that her mother, the donorappellant, was
justified in seeking the assistance of the District Court, (revocation is not
automatic and requires a decision of a court - see Ratnayake v. Mary Nona
(supra)), for the revocation of the gift of Apaladeniya Estate.

For the reasons set out in my judgment I allow the appeal, set aside the order
of the Court of Appeal and affirm the order of the District Court. The
respondent, Mallawa Arachchige Rohini Senanayake, shall pay the appellant,
Ranaviratne Arachchige Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike, a sum of Rs. 10,000 as
costs.

**FERNANDO, J.** â¬"



I agree.

**KULATUNGA, J.**

I have had the advantage of perusing in draft, the judgment of my brother
Amerasinghe, J. He has set out the facts and cited the judicial decisions and
authorities on the issues involved. I agree that upon a proper construction of
the Deed No. 3412, the gift of property which is the subject-matter of the
above action is not a donatio propter nuptias made on account of the marriage
of the 1st defendant-respondent Rohini Senanayake. She is the only daughter of
the donors, the 2nd plaintiff-appellant, (her mother), and her late father who
was the 1st plaintiff in the above action. The said gift was subject to a life
interest in favour of the donors. There is nothing to indicate that it was a
gift to "tempt" the marriage, or on account of the promise of marriage or was
"prompted" by the marriage of the

222

donees taking place, which features constitute the characteristics of a
donatio propter nuptias.

On the face of the Deed the said gift is an "ordinary gift"' made out of
liberality and generosity. As such it gives the donee a "lucrative" rather
than an "onerous" title and hence it is revocable on account of ingratitude.
The use of the expression contained in the said Deed that the gift was "in
consideration of the marriage of the donees" or the condition that it was to
take effect "on the marriage of the donees" are not sufficient to rebut this
position and to make it a donatio propter nuptias or a dowry deed, which is
irrevocable.

I am of the view that the Court of Appeal was in error in regarding the issue
as to the character of the gift as a pure question of law, when it was raised
for the first time in appeal and in interfering with the judgment of the trial
Court on that basis in the absence of sufficient evidence on record to hold
that the Deed was a dotal agreement.

I agree with my brother Amerasinghe, J. that the donee appellant, by
assaulting her donor parents, was guilty of ingratitude, which warrants the
revocation of the gift. The judgment of the District Court allowing its
revocation on the ground of gross ingratitude was, therefore, right.
Accordingly, I allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal
and affirm the judgment of the District Court.

I also agree with the order for costs made by my brother Amerasinghe, J. in a
sum of Rs. 10,000% (Rupees Ten Thousand) and direct Mallawa Arachchige Rohini
Senanayake to pay the said sum to Ratnaviratne Arachchige Dona Podi Nona
Ranaweera Menike.

_Appeal Allowed._
