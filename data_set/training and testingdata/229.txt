S. C. APPLICATION NO. 4/88  
OCTOBER 6 and 7, 1988.

_

Fundamental Rights_ \- _Infliction of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
and punishment_ \- _Article 11 of the Constitution - Application out of time_
\- _Lex non cogit ad impossibilia_ \- _Responsibility of public official in
authority_ \- _Standard of proof - Sections 10(1) and 13 of the Prisons
Ordinance and Rules 121 and 155 of the Prisons Rules_ \- _Liability for

_

The petitioner was arrested on 29.07.87 and produced before the Elpitiya
Magistrate on 18.1,0.87 and remanded to the Galle prison on his orders made
from time to time. While in prison custody on 1.1 2.87 the petitioner was
bathing at a water tank near the prison cell when the 1st respondent was
alleged to have assaulted the petitioner saying he was not entitled to. bathe
there at that time.

**

Held:

**

  1. Though" the application was filed only on 7.1.88 - more than one month after the alleged infringement took place 1.12.1987) - yet being a remand prisoner the petitioner's lack of easy access" to a lawyer and his hospitalization from 2.12.1 987 in the remand prison till his release on 11.1 2.1987 must be taken into account. The principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia. applies in the absence of any lapse or fault. Time here did not begin-to run till 11.12.1 987.
  2. (i) A case of assault by the 1st respondent (a. Prison Guard) had been established where the petitioner suffered a fracture of his left arm and. other injuries on being attacked by a baton by the 1st respondent for failure to comply with his orders not to bathe at the tank near cell C of the Prison.

(ii) Regardless" of Rule 11 of the Prison Rules and the-absence of any
assignment of specific duties regarding the petitioner, the 1st respondent was
acting in the course of his employment or duty when he gave directions to the
petitioner and used force upon him for non-compliance. It was done by the 1st,
respondent in the performance of his master's business and not merely during
such performance.

The assault was an unauthorised or unlawful act which was so connected with
1st respondent's duties as a Prison Guard and in the exercise of the powers
conferred upon him and in the performance of the 'duties he was

**2**

given under S. 10(1) and-S. 13 of the Prisons Ordinance and Rules 121 and 1 55
of the Prisons Rules, that he was acting within the scope of his duties and
powers and therefore performing an executive act Under Article 216 of the
Constitution.

Per Amerasinghe, J. "The test of liability relates to the performance or
purported performance of his official duties and not to his rank or position
in the official hierarchy. If the act was done within the scope of the express
or implied sense of the authority of the public officer concerned, there is
executive or administrative action in the relevant sense."

"To become executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article 1
26 of the Constitution, the act must be done in the course of that business so
as to form part of it, and not be merely coincident in time with it." "Where
there is no express or implied authority, the act of the public officer may
nevertheless be regarded as executive or administrative action if it could be
inferred from the circumstances that the act was done with the intention of
doing good to the State and not for his own purpose. In such a case of
ostensible authority it may be no defence that the officer concerned was
acting beyond his power or authority and even in disregard of a prohibition or
special direction provided, of course, that the act was incidental to what the
officer was employed to do. .

(in) The 2nd respondent (Chief Jailor) and 3rd respondent (Superintendent)
took prompt action to have the petitioner treated for his injuries and
interdicted the 1st respondent. The 2nd to 4th respondents were not
responsible for what the 1st respondent did nor did they condone, ratify or
seek to cover up what was done.

(iv) Public officials are not apart from actual authorisation responsible for
the delicts of their subordinates and the relationship of master and servant
does not exist between a public official and his subordinates.

  5. Per Amerasinghe J. (Ranasinghe C. J. agreeing)

The first respondent acting within the scope of his duties and acting within
his powers violated the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed by
Article 11 of the Constitution by subjecting him to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment and for this the State is liable to pay Rs.
15,000/- as compensation to the petitioner.

Fernando J. held that the 1st respondent and the State are jointly and
severally liable to pay compensation in Rs. 1 5,000/-

(3) _Semble Basis_ of liability for infringement of Article 11 - is it
delictual or a new right sui generis created by the Constitution? On this
point-

(i) Ranasinghe C. J. said it was not necessary to enter upon an analysis of
the earlier judgments in view of the consensus of the Court that the State

**4**

was liable upon the established facts and circumstances of this case but he
would agree with the view taken by Amerasinghe J. founded as it is upon the
opinion expressed hitherto by this Court.

(ii) Fernando. J An impairment of personality - the violation of those
interests which every man- has, as a matter of natural right, in the
possession of an unimpaired person, dignity and*reputation, and whether it be
a public or private right - committed with wrongful intent established
liability in the _achio injunarum;_ patrimonial loss, as well as damages for
mental pain, suffering and distress can be recovered. When the Constitution
recognised the right set out in Article 11, even if it was-a totally new
right, these principles of the common law applied, and the wrongdoer who
violated that right became liable, and his master too, if the wrong was
committed in the course of employment It was not necessary for a new delict to
be created by statute or judicial decision.

The violation of the Fundamental Rights under Article 11 of the Constitution
by 1st respondent involved not only him but also the State in liability as the
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment were inflicted in the
course of 1st respondent's employment under the State.

(hi) Per Amerasinghe, J "Our Court has preferred to treat a violation of a
Fundamental Right as something _sui generis_ created by the Constitution and
not as a delict. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court have consistently
steered away from the vicarious liability approach."

The State must pay compensation to the petitioner.

(4) Assessment of compensation for violation of a Fundamental Rights .

(i) Per Fernando, J The petitioner is entitled to compensation in respect of
the injury, hospitalization. and pain, suffering and .humiliation suffered by
him. In view of the custodial relationship between the 1st respondent and the
petitioner his (1st respondent's) conduct was high handed and in flagrant
disregard of the petitioner's rights. It is however not desirable to assess
the damages under each of these heads. Compensation is assessed at Rs. 1
5,0.00/-.

(ii) Per Amerasinghe, J. (Ranasinghe C.J. agreeing): When in an appropriate
case compensation is awarded for the violation of a Fundamental Right, it is,
I think, by way of an acknowledgement of regret and a _solatium_ for the hurt
caused by the violation of a Fundamental Right and not as a punishment for
duty disregarded or authority abused.

Deterrence is not a relevant element in the assessment of such compensation.
In a case such as this where the 1st. respondent was guilty of outrageous
behaviour it is not a punitive element that must enter into the

**4**

enhancement of compensation payable, but the need to assuage the petitioner's
hurt feelings by a recognition of the enormity of the wrong complained of.
What is sought to be done, by increasing the amount of the award is to give
the petitioner the consolation of knowing that this Court acknowledges the
seriousness of the harm done and that it has tried to establish some
reasonable relation between the wrong done and the solatium applied.. The
whole process of assessing damages where they are 'at large' is essentially a
matter of impression and not addition.

RANASINGHE, C.J.

**

I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of both Fernando,
J., and Amerasinghe, J.,

I have with their findings on the questions of fact which are in issue in
these proceedings.

Fernando, J., has considered an interesting aspect of the earlier judgments
delivered by this Court, which have drawn heavily from the views expressed by
the Privy Council in the case of Maharaj vs. A.G. (1) in regard by the basis
of the liability of the State for infringements of Fundamental rights by
"executive or administrative action.

Fernando, J. is however, of the view that-whatever be the real basis is, in
law, liable to the petitioner in this case upon the facts and circumstances
which have bee established. It is, therefore, and necessary to enter upon an
analysis of the earlier judgments of this Court from the standpoint that has
weighed with Fernando, J. Such a discussion could be left to a more
appropriate case where this matter is raised directly before a specially
constituted larger Bench which have the benefit of a full argument from the
Bar.

**8**

I agree with the view taken by Amerasinghe, J. founded as it is upon the
opinions expressed by this Court in regard to granted to the basis of such
liability.

I also agree with Amerasinghe, J. in regard to the relief to be granted to
petitioner, and in regard to the orders for costs.

**

FERNANDO. J.

**

The Petitioner, a school teacher, claims relief in respect of the alleged
violation of his fundamental rights under Article 11. He was arrested on
29.7.87, and was produced before the Magistrate, Elpitiya, on 18.10.87; orders
for remand, at the Galle Prison, were made and extended later. On 3.12.87 when
the case was called, the court was informed that he was receiving treatment in
hospital, and a further order for remand was made until the next calling date,
namely 17.12.87. On 11.12.87 a motion was filed by an Attorney-at-law on his
behalf that the case be called in open court. The Court was informed that by
letter dated 8.12.87  also journalized on 11.12.87  Attorney-General had
consented to bail; the same day he was released on personal bail.

Relief is sought not in respect of the Petitioner's arrest or detention, but
in regard to an assault by _the_ 1st Respondent, a Prison guard, at about 5.00
p.m. on 1.1 2.87. The Petitioner was bathing at a water tank a short distance
away from the block of cells ("Ward G") to which he was assigned. The 1st
Respondent had been assigned duties that day in connection with Wards C and D;
finding that some of the prisoners in those Wards were missing, he searched
for them, and saw several prisoners bathing at the water tank. Having told
them that they were not permitted to bathe at that time, he ordered them to go
to their Wards; while the others complied with that order, the Petitioner
continued to bathe. The 1st Respondent states that he repeated his order more
firmly, raising his hand and shouting at the Petitioner to go away, whereupon
the latter got ready to leave but slipped and fell; he was not aware that the
Petitioner suffered any injury. However, the Petitioner states that he told
the 1st Respondent that he had obtained permission to bathe at that

**9**

time, but the 1st Respondent told him to get out, and then kicked and
assaulted him, despite his pleas; he then left, but the 1st Respondent
followed, picked up a baton from a table in the Library, and hit him
repeatedly, despite his cries that his hand was broken. The Petitioner and
other Prison officers and prisoners have made statements, some of which are
substantially consistent with the Petitioner's version; some of them do not
mention any incident whatsoever; and none of them make any mention of a fall.
All these statements, as well as statements made to the Police, were filed
with the affidavits of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, and no objection was taken
to their admissibility or relevance; all parties referred to and relied on.
portions of these statements.

The Petitioner complained of the assault' to the 2nd Respondent, the Chief
Jailor, on the later's routine visit to the Ward that evening, which was
recorded the same evening by a jailer on his instructions; on the next day he
directed that a full inquiry be held, and the statements of other witnesses*
were recorded on 2.12.87 and 3.12.87. The 2nd Respondent and the 3rd
Respondent (the Superintendent of Prisons, Galle) also took prompt action to
have the Petitioner treated at the Prison hospital, and then sent to the Galle
Hospital for treatment and for examination by the Judicial Medical Officer.
The Petitioner was accordingly admitted to the Galle Hospital on 2.12.87; the
3rd Respondent wrote to the Judicial Medical Officer on 3.12.87, but as the
Petitioner was discharged from the Galle Hospital on 3.12.87, the Judicial
Medical Officer was unable (as appears from his reply dated 8.1 2.87 to the
3rd Respondent) to submit a report on the Petitioner as the Petitioner was not
there. That reply was received on 10.12.87, and on 11.12.87 the 3rd Respondent
again sent the. Petitioner to the Galle Hospital specifically for examination
by the Judicial Medical Officer. Two medical reports submitted by the latter
establish that, the Petitioner had suffered a fracture of his left arm, below
the elbow, and that he had other injuries consistent with an assault With 3
baton, from 3*12.87 to 11.12.87, the Petitioner was in the Prison Hospital.

It is common ground that the 1st Respondent was promptly interdicted, and that
disciplinary proceedings as well as a criminal prosecution are. pending
against him.

**10**

A preliminary objection was taken that the petition filed on 7.1.88 was out of
time as more than one month has elapsed after the alleged infringement on 1.1
2.87. It was submitted that visits by lawyers and relatives were not
restricted, and that the Petitioner had the opportunity to consult lawyers.
There are two independent reasons why this contention cannot succeed, A remand
prisoner cannot contact a lawyer with the same ease and facility as other
persons; additional time has necessarily to be spent in sending messages to,
or in awaiting a visit from, a relative, who would then have to contact a
lawyer ; and more time would be necessary to give proper instructions. The
period of time necessary would depend on the circumstances of each case. Here,
the Petitioner was hospitalised from 2.1 2.87 until his release, and was thus
prevented from taking immediate action to petition this Court for redress : an
impediment, to the exercise of his fundamental right (under Article 17) to
apply to this Court, caused by the very infringement complained of. Further,
the fact that he had been assaulted, or that an injury had been inflicted on
him, would not _per se_ bring him within Article 11 ; whether the treatment
meted out to him would fall within Article 11 would depend on the nature and
extent of the injury caused ; until the Petitioner had knowledge, or could
with reasonable diligence have discovered, that an injury sufficient to bring
him within Article 11 had resulted, time did not begin to run. I need mention
only _Gamaethige v. Siriwardena_ (2) where I had occasion to refer to several
decisions of this Court which support the application of the principle _lex
non cog it ad impossibilia_ in the absence of any lapse or fault. On the
application of that principle, time did not begin to run in this case until
11.12.87, and the preliminary objection fails.

Counsel for the Petitioner strenuously contended that the 2nd and 3rd
Respondents were also culpable and liable because they had participated in a "
cover-up ", although admittedly they had not instigated the assault and were
not even present when it occurred. It was his submission that there had been a
deliberate attempt to prevent the Petitioner being medically examined, and
that it was only when they knew he was to be released that he was sent for
examination ; because they realised that thereafter they would not be able to
have him examined. This contention is

**11**

not supported at all by the documentary evidence referred to earlier. As far
as the Respondents were concerned, 17.12.87 was the next calling date, and it
is likely that on 11.1 2.87 they were unaware that the Petitioner was to be
released. Further, commendably prompt action was taken, throughout, firstly,
to have him treated and examined by the Judicial Medical Officer (and it was
through sheer inadvertence that this got delayed), and secondly, to take
disciplinary action against the 1st Respondent. In these circumstances, they
were neither responsible for nor did they condone, ratify or seek to " cover-
up " the act of their subordinate : public officials are not, apart from
actual authorisation, responsible for the delicts of their subordinates, and
the relationship of master and servant does not exist between a public
official and his subordinate, (a)

I now turn to the incident of 1.12.87: In his affidavit in this Court, the
Petitioner says that .the 1 st Respondent asked him why he was on remand on
being told that he was in custody under the Emergency Regulations, the 1st
Respondent stated :

You dogs are the fellows who are trying to bring the _Government down_ and _we
are here on duty_ to teach you dogs a lesson so that you will not have your
limbs to do anything in future.

This was supported by an affidavit sworn by one Shantha who had been on remand
till 23.12.87. Counsel for the 1st Respondent referred to the principle of
liability enunciated in _Velmurugu v Attorney-General (3)_ :

**12**

statement to the Police on his release as well as the other .statements
recorded on 2.12.87 and 3.12.87, make no mention of any such utterance by the
1st Respondent; that Shantha made no statement either to the Prison
authorities or to the Police. On the available evidence, I have no hesitation
in rejecting this part of the Petitioner's story.

It remains to consider whether the Petitioner suffered these injuries as a
result of a fall, or as a result of an assault by the 1st Respondent. Apart
from the 1st Respondent's statement and his affidavit in this Court, there is
no material supporting his version. The standard proof in these cases is
usually expressed as involving the " preponderance of probability ". There
are, undoubtedly, degrees of probability within that standard, and there must
be, as Denning, L.J., said in _Bater v. Bater,_ (4) " a degree of probability
which is commensurate with the occasion ". Morns, L.J., in _Hornal v.
Neuberger Products Ltd_ (5) said that "the very elements of gravity become a
part of the whole range of circumsta'nces which have to be weighed in the
scale when deciding as to the balance of probabilities ". In the end, as
observed by Wanasundera, J., in _Velmurugu's_ case (3), " the petitioner, must
prove his allegations to the satisfaction of the Court" and in _Kapugeekiyana
v. Hettiarachchi,_ (6) Wimalaratne, J., agreed that "the civil, and not the
criminal standard of persuasion applies, with this observation that the nature
and gravity of an issue must necessarily determine the manner of attaining
reasonable satisfaction of the truth of that issue ".

**13**

In considering the Petitioner's version, his attempt to distort the facts
cannot be ignored. I am nevertheless of the view that an assault by the 1st
Respondent, as alleged in the Petitioner's original statement, has been
established. There is no doubt that the Petitioner did suffer serious injuries
that evening the only dispute or altercation involving the Petitioner was with
the 1st Respondent; no reason has been suggested why other officers and
prisoners should falsely implicate the 1st Respondent; and the medical
evidence that the fracture and other injuries were the result of repeated
blows with an instrument such as a baton has not been challenged. It is much
more probable that these injuries were caused by blows with a baton, rather
than by a fail, and I so hold.

Prison Rule 132 in requiring all Prison officers "without exception, to treat
the prisoners with kindness and humanity ", may well be a counsel of
perfection. The enforcement of discipline may occasionally warrant the use of
some force, and some latitude is, perhaps, permissible in deciding whether in
the circumstances of a particular case the force used was excessive. Action
and reaction can seldom be nicely balanced where a decision to use force has
to be taken on the spur of the moment, and a strict application of Rule 132
may not always be practicable, A single blow even with a baton, would be
unlawful, but, arguably, would seldom amount to cruel or inhuman or degrading
treatment : but a brutal assault as in this case, commencing with kicks and
blows, and continued in an aggravated form - by repeated blows with a baton -
even after the Petitioner complied with the order given to him, amounts to
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. As it was inflicted for a supposed
breach of discipline, it may also amount to " punishment " I am of the view
that it does not amount to " torture ", which seems to me to require a further
element : an objective of forcing a confession, or of facilitating an
interrogation, or otherwise influencing future statements or behaviour.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondents that the 1st Respondent had not
been assigned any duties in relation to the Petitioner or Ward G. Further,
that a Prison Guard had no power to enforce discipline by giving orders to
prisoners, or to use

**14**

force in connection therewith, as Rule 11 (of the Prison Rules) provides that
a guard " shall not take any part in the _discipline_ of the jail ". In reply
to questions from us as to the duty of a prison guard to maintain order, even
by using force, in situations such as a fight among prisoners, an attempt to
start a fire, or damage to property, it was submitted that (apart from
situations where persons sought to break in or break out of the jail), a
prison guard's duty was primarily to watch, and to report any breach of
discipline to the appropriate officer ; he could .take action in respect of
such breaches only upon orders from a superior officer. In the context of the
Ordinance and the Rules, " discipline of the jail " in Rule 11 cannot be given
the meaning contended for. It is unnecessary to consider the precise meaning
of this phrase in that Rule, for other provisions of the Ordinance and the
Rules indicate that the maintenance of order is within the scope of
employment, and duty, of a prison guard ;

Every _prison officer_ shall, for the purposes of this Ordinance, be deemed to
be always on duty. " (S. 10(1))

It shall be the duty of every prison officer to preserve _order and
discipline_ among the prisoners in accordance with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the rules made under

section 94 and for such purpose it shall be lawful for a prison officer to use
all such means, including such degree of force, as may reasonably be necessary
to compel obedience to any lawful directions given by him. " (Section. 13)

Each _subordinate officer_ shall perform such duties as may from time to time
be prescribed by the Jailer for the purpose _of preserving discipline_ and
enforcing diligence, cleanliness, order and conformity to the rules of the
prison. " (Rule 121)

" No jailer or _subordinate officer_ shall - (18) fail to maintain _order and
discipline "_ (Rule 1 55)

A " prison officer " includes a " subordinate officer " (section 7), and a
prison guard falls into that category (Rule 119). Regardless of the precise
meaning of Rule 11, the maintenance

**15**

of order and discipline, and the enforcement of lawful directions, is within
the scope of employment of a prison guard. I therefore hold that the 1st
Respondent was acting in the course of his employment, or duty, when he gave
directions to the Petitioner, and used force upon the Petitioner's non-
compliance therewith. Even though he had not been assigned any specific duties
in relation to the Petitioner, his act was within the general scope of his
employment ; it was not an act done while on his own business and for his own
purposes ", nor was it an unauthorised and wrongful act so unconnected with
the authorised act as to be an independent act ; it was done _in_ the
performance of his master's business and not merely _during_ such performance
; although it amounted to wilful wrongdoing, it was nevertheless in the course
of his employment, and not for his own business, purposes .or benefit ; even
assuming that there had been a prohibition on the use of excessive force by
prison guards, that would not have been a prohibition which limited the sphere
of employment, but a prohibition which only dealt with conduct within the
sphere of employment. These are the basic principles of our law applicable to
determining whether an act was " in the course of employment ". (b)

However, Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the question of liability
of the State was to be determined by the principles laid down in
_Thadchanamoorthi v. A.G._ (7), _Velmurugu v. A.G._ (3) and _Goonewardene v.
Perera_ (8) and it becomes necessary to consider the basis, and nature and
extent, of liability.

In the _Thadchanamoorthi_ case, Wanasundera, J., having held on the facts that
an infringement had not been proved, expressed disagreement with the
submission that the act of a public officer would not constitute State action
unless done within the scope of the powers given to him," which means that if
it is an unlawful act or is an act considered ultra vires, it would not be
considered State action ". He found to be more reasonable the approach that
all acts of a public official, whether acting within the terms of his powers
or acting under colour of office would be State action but felt that this went
too far as there could be cases where an act of a public officer acting under
colour of

**16**

office ought to be considered purely as an individual or private act of the
person concerned and not as an official act". It must be observed with respect
that an ultra vires or an unlawful (even criminal) act can be done by a
servant " in the course of employment", and would render the master liable,
(c) and accordingly that possibility was, of itself, not a good ground for
refusing to apply the common law principles of liability. Observations made in
that case also tend to suggest that the existence of an " administrative
practice " may be relevant to State liability and to the question whether an
infringement was by " executive or administrative action ".

In the _Velmurugu_ case, three Judges held on the facts that the infringement
had not been established, while the minority took the contrary view. Two of
the Judges who constituted the majority, but not the third, agreed with the
formulation, quoted above, (3) as to the liability of the State - strictly,
for the acts of " high " officers, and for acts done " under colour of office
" in the case of other officers. The two Judges who constituted the minority,
relying on _Maharaj v. A.G._ (1) took the view that" this is not vicarious
liability it is the liability of the State itself ; it is not a liability in
tort at all it is a liability in the public law of the State " (Sharvananda,
J.) ; they considered the existence of an " administrative practice " to be
irrelevant.

In _Goonewardene v, Perera_ (8) processionists were directed to disperse by a
Police Officer who wrongly believed that a permit was required by law ; upon
failure to disperse, the Petitioner was arrested. The test suggested by the
Respondents - " that the State has either expressly or impliedly authorised or
ratified or adopted or condoned or acquiesced in the acts constituting the
infringement" - was held to have been satisfied, and the State was held liable
for the wrongful arrest. Although that concluded the matter, Soza, J.,
proceeded to consider the formulations in the previous decisions. He
considered the distinction drawn by Wanasundera, J., between " high " and "
subordinate " officials, to _be obiter,_ and did not agree that any
distinction should be drawn oh the basis of rank. (However neither Judge made
any reference to the recognised distinction between the primary
representatives of a corporate body, and its servants (d), (9). He

**17**

agreed with the minority view, as formulated by Sharvananda. J. as well as the
further elaboration thereof in _Mariadas v. A.G._ (10):

" What the petitioner is complaining of is an infringement of his fundamental
right by executive or administrative action, that the State has through the
instrumentality of an over-zealous or despotic official committed the
transgression of his constitutional right. The protection afforded by Article
126 is against infringement of fundamental rights by the State, acting by some
public authority endowed by it with the necessary coercive powers. The relief
granted is principally against the State, although the delinquent official may
also be directed to make amends and/or suffer punishment. "

The Petitioner in _Mariadas Raj v. A.G._ had been found in a house which was
being searched by a Police Officer he was suspected to be an illegal
immigrant, and was arrested. As he had not been informed of the reason for
such arrest, the arrest was held to be in violation of Article 13 (1).
Clearly, the arrest had been made in the course of duty of that Police
Officer.

In both these cases, the Police Officer who actually made the arrest had not
been made a Respondent to the petition filed, and the arrest had been wrongly
attributed to another officer the State was ordered to pay compensation.

In other cases (6, 11) relief has been granted against the persons actually
guilty of the infringement, and not against the State in cases alleging
violations by corporate bodies, relief has been granted against such bodies,
and not against the State (12, 13, 14). In _Nallanayagam v. Gunatilake_ (15)
the Petitioner had been illegally kept in custody for three days longer than
authorised, and the State was ordered to pay compensation for the violation of
his fundamental right under Article 1 3 (2).

The Petitioner is entitled to relief is the liability, primarily and
principally, or solely, that Of the State ? Is the liability of the State in
respect of an infringement of fundamental rights by its agent

**18**

or employee more extensive than the liability of a master for a like
infringement by his servant? Or is the 1st Respondent alone liable ? The
principles laid down in some of the decisions referred to above are _obiter_
to some extent they are mutually inconsistent in some, orders were made only
against the State, in others only against the wrongdoer, and in yet others
against both.

It is necessary to refer to _Maharaj v. A.G._ (1) The Appellant, a member of
the Bar of Trinidad and Tobago was sentenced to 7 days imprisonment for
contempt as later held by the Privy Council (13), the Judge (of the High
Court) had failed, to observe a fundamental rule of natural justice prior to
making his order, and there thus resulted a deprivation of liberty otherwise
than by due process of law, (which was a fundamental right guaranteed by the
Constitution). The Constitution entitled a person to apply to the High Court
for redress in respect of a contravention of that right such an application
was made by the Appellant the same day, resulting in a stay order being
granted by another High Court Judge. The matter ultimately came up before yet
another Judge, who dismissed the application and the Appellant served his
sentence. He had no right of appeal against the original order. After serving
his sentence, he applied to the Privy Council for, and obtained, special leave
to appeal it was held on appeal that the original order was bad. In the
meantime, he also appealed to the Court of Appeal in respect of the second
order (refusing redress), and, upon that appeal being dismissed, appealed to
the Privy Council once again. There was no suggestion that the original order
was made totally without jurisdiction, or in bad faith it was an error in the
course of the exercise of the judicial power of the State. Although the
original order was wrong, the judge who made it enjoyed complete immunity from
suit. The constitutional provision for redress (by the High Court) in respect
of a contravention of a fundamental-right had to be applied as the Appellant
had already served his sentence by the time the Privy Council heard the
appeal, a mere reversal of the second order, or a declaration that it was
unconstitutional, was no redress - as it certainly would have been had the
Appellant not served any part of the sentence.

**19**

In that context, the Privy Council (by a majority) held that although the
Judge was immune, the State was liable to pay compensation, as the
Constitution created a new liability ;

.... no change is involved in the rule that a judge cannot be made personally
liable for what he has done when _acting or purporting to act in a judicial
capacity._ The claim for redress ..... for what has been done by a judge is a
claim against the State for what has been done in the exercise of the judicial
power of the State. This is not vicarious liability it is a liability of the
State itself. It is not a liability in tort at all it is a liability in the
public law of the State, not of the judge himself, which has been newly
created by .... the Constitution. "

**20**

_

by the executive arm_ of the State. So if his detention amounted to a
contravention of his rights it was a contravention by the State against which
he was entitled to protection. "

_

Maharaj_ commended itself to my Lord the Chief Justice rather than the
majority view, this decision may possibly be explained as consistent with
other aspects of the _Maharaj_ case on the basis that the act of detention was
ancillary to, and therefore part of, the judicial act, and was thus not really
" executive or administrative -action" within the meaning of Article 126;
However, _Kumarasinghe ,v. A.G._ (16) and _Dayananda v. Weerasinghe_ (17)
cannot be explained on that basis, for there the judicial orders were the
consequence of false and misleading reports by Police Officers, and "
executive action " was thus the cause of the detention.

But even assuming that all those decisions may be explained on the basis that
the alleged infringement was not by " executive or administrative action ",
the _Maharaj_ principle would yet cast liability on the State in a case where
the alleged infringement was clearly by executive action, although the alleged
wrongdoer was immune from suit. When that very situation arose in
_Mallikarachchi v. Shiva Pasupati, Attorney-General_ (20) a Bench of five
Judges held that a petition alleging that a proscription order made by the
President, under the Emergency Regulations,

**21**

was in violation of fundamental rights could not be entertained, because of
the immunity conferred on the President by Article 35 (1). While agreeing that
the President enjoys immunity from suit, Wanasundera, J., held that having
regard to the provisions of Article 35 (3) the Attorney-General was the proper
respondent. The other Judges held that the impugned act did not relate to a
matter coming within. Article 35 (3), and therefore the Attorney-General was
not the proper respondent in terms of that Article. The Court did not apply
the _Maharaj_ Principle and hold that the act of the President (clearly "
executive action") in violation of the Petitioner's fundamental rights would
cast liability on the State, despite the immunity from suit of the President
himself. I am therefore of the view that under Chapter 111, read with Article
1 26, of the Constitution, no direct liability is cast upon the State in
respect of a violation of fundamental rights, and that the principles
enunciated in the _Maharaj_ case are inapplicable to our Constitution. Despite
_dicta_ as to their applicability, this Court has, more often than not, acted
on the contrary basis views expressed in some decisions that the wrongdoer is
also liable represent an uneasy compromise between _sole_ liability on the
_Maharaj_ principle and the principles of vicarious liability which have been
repudiated.

Although several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have been
cited,- particularly in the _Velmurugu_ (3) case, they do not establish that a
violation of fundamental rights by a State officer results indirect, as
distinct from vicarious, liability of the State. The corresponding American
Constitutional provisions are very different to ours, and the principles
formulated in those decisions cannot be considered applicable to our
Constitutional provisions without close scrutiny. Six of the decisions cited
relate to proceedings against State officers, acting wrongfully and in excess
of their authority, but the-State was not held liable for their acts. The
Federal judicial power was held competent " to afford redress for the wrong
_6y dealing with the officer_ and _the result_ of his exertion of power" (21,
22, 23, 24, 25, 26), and not against the State. Indeed, it is doubtful whether
any such theory of State liability could have been advanced on the basis of
the Constitution, and the Amendments guaranteeing fundamental rights. It would
appear that the doctrine of sovereign immunity

**22**

was recognised (see also the Eleventh Amendment) so as to preclude a State
being directly impleaded in respect of the acts of its officers. Even State
officers may have been entitled to that plea, and it was to mitigate the
consequences of that doctrine that a State officer seeking' to enforce an
unconstitutional enactment is " stripped of his official or representative
character, and is subjected _in his person_ to the consequences of his
individual conduct "such " individuals who, as officers of the State are
clothed with some duty in regard to the enforcement of the laws of the State,
and who threaten ......... to enforce ....:.... an unconstitutional act,
violating the Federal Constitution, may be enjoined by a Federal court "
(27,28)

_

United States v. Classic_ (29) has been cited as authority for the principle
that -

misuse of power, possessed by virtue of State law and made possible only
because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of State law, is action
taken _under colour of_ State law".

That was not a principle derived from an interpretation of any Constitutional
provision, but was simply an application of a _statute_ making it an offence
for anyone " under colour of any law " to subject another to the deprivation
of Constitutional rights."

Many of the principles developed, in the American decisions appear to have
been necessitated by the more restricted form of protection of fundamental
rights - " Congress shall make no law . . . ", " No State' shah make or
enforce any law...".  

Consequently it has been held in relation to the Fourteenth Amendment - .

" It is state action of a particular character that is prohibited, individual
invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the amendment. "
(30)

**23**

Even the right of Congress to legislate was held to be circumscribed -

" It is absurd to affirm that, because the rights of life, liberty, and
property are by the amendment sought to be protected against invasion on the
part of the state without due process of law. Congress may, therefore,
provide, for due process of law for their vindication in every case ; that
Congress may establish laws for their equal protection. In fine, the
legislation which Congress is authorised to adopt in this behalf is not
general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective
legislation. " (30)

Unfortunately, such statements appear to have influenced the assumption in
some decisions of this Court that -

Chapter 3 on Fundamental Rights in our Constitution is concerned with public
law. The protection afforded is , against contravention of these rights by
executive or administrative action of the State and its organs. " (8)

(31) no relief could have been granted. Article 126 does not define an
ingredient of an

**24**

infringement of fundamental rights ; it merely ousts the jurisdiction of all
other Courts and tribunals in respect of one category of such infringements,
namely those committed by " executive or administrative action. " It follows
that the question whether there-has been an infringement must be determined
independently of whether such infringement was by executive action likewise,
the question whether such an infringement by an employee casts liability on
his master, a master's liability for an infringement by his servant cannot
vary accordingly as he is a private individual or the State the same principle
of liability - vicarious or otherwise - must apply. If in circumstances
constituting a violation of Article 12 (3) a citizen is refused access to two
neighbouring shops one privately owned, the other State-owned - by a shop
employee, and if the private owner and his employee are sued for damages, and
a petition is filed under Article 1 26 against the State and its employee, can
it ever be contended that the principles to be applied to determine the
liability of the respective owners, and employees, would be different ? If as
Article 12(1} requires, all persons are entitled to the equal protection of
the law, can a person discriminated against by a private shop-owner's employee
be differently treated to a person discriminated against by a State employee ?

I am unable to accept the submission of Counsel for the Petitioner that the
principles of liability applicable are these laid down in the decisions in
Thadchanamoorthi (7), Velmurugu (3) and Goonewardene v. Perera (8) the
observations of Soza, J., in the latter case were obiter, and in the other two
cases it was held on the facts that there was no infringement. Indeed, in all
the cases in which infringements were established, the wrongdoer was acting in
the course of, and within the scope of, his employment or duty, and the State
would thus have been liable on the ordinary principles of vicarious liability.
To that extent only could the wrongdoer be said to have been acting " under
colour of office", or as an instrumentality of the State. Further, decisions
of Benches of five Judges in Fernando v. A.G. (18) and Mallikarachchi v. Shiva
Pasupati, Attorney-General (10) necessarily involve a rejection of the Maharaj
principle of State liability. In Kapugeekiyana's (6) case too there was no
order against the State Considering that Chapter 111 of the

**25**

Constitution protects fundamental rights against infringements by all persons,
and not only by the State, I think that the question whether such a right has
been infringed by a Respondent, and if so whether any other person is also
liable in respect of such infringement, must be determined by the same legal
principles. The principles whereby an employer or a principal is to be made
responsible for the act of an employee or agent have not been laid down in the
Constitution, and hence must be determined by reference to other (statutory or
common law) principles of our law those principles do not vary (except perhaps
in terms of the State (Liability in Delict) Act). Questions relating to acts
which are ultra vires or done in violation of prohibitions, do arise, but the
common law principles are sufficiently virile and flexible to deal with these.
I am conscious that the time limits fixed by Article 1 26 may create
difficulties of proof of loss or damage, but the power of this Court under
Article 126 (4) is extensive, and enables the Court to give appropriate
directions (even after an infringement has been held to have been committed)
to obtain the material necessary to quantify the loss or damage.

A wrongful act - the invasion of a right, or the violation of a legally
protected interest - causing pecuniary loss to the plaintiff, committed
wilfully, is sufficient to establish liability in the Aquilian action ; in the
modern law, patrimonial loss need not be proved where the object of the action
is not to obtain compensation for harm done but to establish a right. An
impairment of personality \- the violation of those interests which every man
has, as a matter of natural right, in the possession of an unimpaired person,
dignity and reputation, and whether it be. a public or a private right -
committed with wrongful intent establishes liability in the _actio injuriarum_
; patrimonial loss, as well as damages for mental pain, suffering and distress
can be recovered (I). When the Constitution recognised the right set out in
Article 11, even if it was a totally new right, these principles of the common
law applied, and the wrongdoer who violated that right became liable ; "and
his master, too, if the wrong was committed in the course of employment, (b)
It was not necessary for a new delict to be created by statute or judicial
decision. The 1st Respondent is thus liable in respect of the infliction of
cruel, inhuman and

**26**

degrading treatment and punishment on the Petitioner, for which the State is
also liable as it was inflicted in the course, and within the scope, of his
employment under the State.

The Petitioner is entitled to compensation in respect of the injury,
hospitalization, and pain, suffering and humiliation which is-not easy to
assess due to the paucity of evidence suffered by him in view of the custodial
relationship between the 1st Respondent and the Petitioner, his conduct was
high handed and in flagrant disregard of the Petitioner's rights. While I was
at first inclined to attempt to assess the damages under each of these heads
separately, I agree with my brother Amerasinghe, J., that this is not
desirable. I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to compensation, which I
assess at Rs. 1 5,000, together with costs in a sum of Rs. 1,500, from the 1st
Respondent and the State jointly and severally.

The Petitioner's claim against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents fails, and the
application is distressed as against them, without costs. Their conduct has
been unexceptionable, and had they been compelled to retain private Counsel,
we would have been inclined to award them costs.

AMERASINGHE, J.

**

I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment of my brother,
Fernando, J. and I. entirely agree with his views on the question of the
burden of proof in cases of this sort and the scope of the authority of prison
guards, I am in complete agreement with his reasoning and the conclusion which
he has reached with regard to the delinquent conduct of the First Respondent
and the liability of the State to, pay compensation to the Petitioner, I also
concur in dismissing the application against the Second and Third Respondents
and agree with the order of my brother Fernando, J. with regard to costs.

I am unable, however, to extend my concurrence to the legal reasoning of my
learned brother in the expository part of his judgment dealing with the manner
in which the State becomes responsible for the wrongful conduct of the First
Respondent. I am also unable to agree that the First Respondent is jointly and
severally liable with the State. I should also like to add a word on the
question of compensation.

Article 126 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Court, among other
things, to grant such relief or make such directions as it may deem just and
equitable where any person alleges that a fundamental right or language right
recognised by the Constitution and relating to such person has been infringed
or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative action.

Relief is only available in respect of an executive act. No relief is
available in respect of a legislative or judicial act. (E.g. see _Peter Leo
Fernando_ v. _Attorney-General and Two Others,_ (18) _Jayasinghe_ v.
_Mahendran & others, _(19) _Dayananda_ v. _Weerasinghe and Others,_ (17) In
_Velmurugu_ v. _Attorney-General and Another,_ (3) Sharvananda, J. said that
Article 126 "is directed against the executive and is designed as a corrective
for executive excess only.

The expression " executive or administrative action " has not been defined in
the Constitution, but it has been explained in several decisions of this
Court. It is clear that the words have not

**28**

been narrowly construed to mean the acts of the President of the Republic
merely because Article 4 of the Constitution says that " the executive power
of the people shall be exercised by the President. " (See _Jayanetti_ v. _The
Land Reform Commission and Others,_ (32) The expression embraces local as well
as central authorities and includes any individual officer who exercises
executive functions of a public nature. _(A.K. Velmurugu_ v. _The Attorney-
General and Another,_ (3). As Atukorale, J. observed in _Rajaratnev, Air
Lanka,_ (33) :

An examination of our decisions indicate that this expression embraces actions
not only of the Government itself but also of organs instrumentalities or
agencies of the Government. The Government may act through the agency of its
officers. It may also act through the agency of juridical persons set up by
the State by, under or in accordance with a statute. "

In S. _C. Perera_ v. _University Grant Commission,_ (12) Sharvananda, J. said
that :

In the context of fundamental rights, the ' State ' includes every repository
of State power. The expression ' executive or administrative action ' embraces
executive action of the State or its agencies or instrumentalities exercising
governmental functions. It refers to exertion of State power in all its forms.
"

Justice Stiarvananda quoted these words two years later in _Nimal Tissa
Wijetunga_ v. _The Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka,

_

(34)-" .

In the _Velmurugu case (supra)_ at pp. 224 _in fin.._ \- 225 (3) Sharvananda,
J. said :

**29**

The 'Executive' may be broadly defined as the authority within the State which
administers the law, carries on the business of the Government and maintains
order within and security from without the State Executive functions thus
include, in addition to execution of the law, the conduct of military
operations, the provision of supervision of such welfare services as
education, public health transport etc. "

It has been decided that the Police (see _Mariadas Raj_ v. _Attorney Genera/,_
(10) ; _Vivienne Goonewardene_ v. _Hector Perera  
  
and Others _(8) _Am a I Sudath Silva_ v. _KodituWakku Inspector of Police and
Others,_ (35) the Janatha Estate Development Board,  
  
(see _G.A. Eheliyagoda and Others_ v. _Janata Estate Development Board and
Others,_ (13) the University Grants Commission (see _Perera_ v. _University
Grants Commission,_ (12) the People's Bank (see _Ariyapala Gunaratne_ v. _The
People's Bank,_ (31) Municipal  
  
Councils (see _Roberts_ v, _Ratnayake,_ (36) and Air Lanka (see _Rajaratne_ v.
_Air Lanka,_ (33) are state agencies or instrumentalities for the purpose of
exercising executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article
126 of the Constitution.

However, not every public institution is such an agency or instrument of
Government. It has been held, for instance that the Insurance Corporation of
Sri Lanka (see _Wijetunge_ v. _Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka,_ (34) and
the National Paper Corporation (see _P. G. Chandrasena and Others_ v.
_National Paper Corporation and Others,_ (37) are not Government agencies
having the relevant capacity for executive or administrative action. The
question whether the University of Colombo (see* _Gunasena Thenabadu_ v.
_University of Colombo and Others_ (38) and the Bank of Ceylon are government
agencies (see _Gamini Samarasinghe v. . Bank of Ceylon and Another)_ (39) has
been raised but left undecided by this Court,

In the matter before us, the First Respondent is a Prison Guard, the Second
Respondent is the Chief Jailor of the Galle Prison and the Third Respondent is
the Superintendent of the Galle Prison and the Fourth Respondent (who was
later dropped from the

**30**

proceedings) was the Commissioner of Prisons. They are, like Police Officers,
officials of a Government Department - the Prisons Department \- concerned
with the vital function of law enforcement. They are all persons who exercise
executive functions of a public nature and, therefore, have the capacity to
perform executive-or administrative acts within the meaning of Article 1 26 of
the Constitution.

However, it is not every act of a public official that would amount to
executive or administrative action within the meaning of Article 1 26 of the
Constitution-Where in the circumstances of. a case an act is to be considered
purely as a private act of the person concerned and not as an official act,
such an act would not constitute executive or administrative action which
would open the way to relief in terms of Article 1 26 of the Constitution.

Sharvananda, J. in _Nimal Tissa Wi/etunge_ v. _The Insurance Corporation of
Sri Lanka,_ (34).

Where the act of a public officer is expressly authorised by the State it has
been said that such an act would be an,executive or administrative act within
the meaning of Article 126 of the Constitution. (See _Vivienne Goonewardene_
v. _Hector Perera_ and _Others,_ (8) Such cases are no doubt rare, for as
Wanasundera, J. says in _Thadchanamoorthi's_ case (supra) at p. 137 _fin._ \-
138:

It seems extremely improbable that a government would openly authorise acts of
torture or such other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment, unless in
war time or in emergency situations. "

There was no express authorisation in-this case.

There will" be executive or __ administrative action not only if the act in
question was expressly authorised by the State, but also if

**31**

the State impliedly authorised it or adopted or condoned or acquiesced in that
act. (Cf. Vivienne Goonewardene's case,, _(supra),_ at p. 436 _fin. -_ 437).
These cases are few and far between, although, perhaps rather more frequent
than those in which the acts complained of are expressly authorised. As
Wanasundera, J. in _Thadchanamoorthi's_ case, _(supra)_ explained at p. 138 :

It is more likely that a government may covertly sanction such illegal acts or
connive in the perpetration of such acts, or sanction them or tolerate them to
such an extent that they become virtual administrative practice. "

This must not be construed to mean that an administrative practice must always
be proved in order to establish acquiescence. Approval of even an isolated act
would be sufficient (see the _Velmurugu_ case, _(supra),_ per Sharvananda, J.
at p. 231 _fin.)._ Moreover, where the act has been expressly or impliedly
authorised there will be executive or administrative action even if the
officer concerned used some unauthorised mode of doing the authorised action.
There was no implied authorisation in this case.

If the act of a public officer has not been expressly or impliedly authorised
or adopted or condoned or acquiesced in by the State, would it be executive or
administrative action merely because it was the act of a high official ? In
the _Velmurugu_ case, _(supra),_ at p. 21 2 Wanasundera, J. stated that he was
" inclined to the view that the State should be held strictly, liable for
_any_ acts of its high state officials. " With great respect, I think the
proposition was somewhat" too widely stated. If a police officer raped a
woman, after arresting her and taking her to the police station, would that be
executive and administrative action ? I believe that Wanasundera, J. would not
have drawn any distinction between a rape committed by a humble constable and
such a transgression by a high ranking police officer. Indeed, Wanasundera, J.
in _Velmurugu's_ case,

**32**

_

(supra) _at p. 206 _fin._ \--207 makes no distinction between high and low
officers of the police when he said ;

_

"_ Mr. Pulienayagam relied heavily on the above passage - for the submission
that acts or omissions on the part of a police officer done under colour of
office or in the purported exercise of his powers would involve the State in
liability. Nevertheless he made a significant concession, namely, that there
could be acts which can be regarded as an individual or personal act not
entailing liability of the State. As an example he gave the case of a police
officer arresting a woman, then taking her to the police station and raping
her  "

**33**

at p. 212 ; per Soza, J. in _(Vivienne Goonewardene's_ case, (supra), at p.
439). There would be executive or administrative action even if the acts in
question were unauthorised provided they are so connected with the acts that
have been authorised that this may be regarded as modes, although improper-
modes, of doing them.

However, if the unauthorised and wrongful act of a public officer is not so
connected with an authorised act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an
independent act, there is no executive or administrative action for in such a
case the officer is not acting in the performance of his official duties but
has gone outside of it. He can no longer be said to be doing, although in a'
wrong and unauthorised way, what he was authorised to do. He is doing what he
was not authorised to do at all. There is no executive or administrative
action merely because the act was done at a time when the officer was engaged
in official business. To become executive or administrative action within the
meaning of Article 126 of the Constitution, the act must be done in the course
of that business so as to form part of it, and not be merely coincident in
time with it.

Although Senior State Counsel maintained that the First Respondent was acting
in an unauthorised manner and was, therefore, not acting in the performance of
his duties, the First Respondent in this case was not in my view acting-
privately during the time he was on duty. His assault was an unauthorised or
unlawful act but one which was so connected with his duties as a Prison Guard
and in the exercise of the powers conferred upon him and in the performance of
the duties he was given by Section 10(1) and Section 1 3 of the Prisons
Ordinance (Cap. 54 L.E.) and by Rules 121 and 155 of the Prison Rules framed
Under the, Prisons Ordinance (Vol. I -Subsidiary Legislation) that he was
acting within the scope of his duties and within the scope of his powers and
was therefore performing an executive act within the meaning of Article 1 26
of the Constitution. He abused his powers when he laid violent hands upon the
Petitioner for the purpose of or for the honestly purported purpose of
furthering

**34**

his authority to maintain discipline and the State must therefore be held
liable for his wrongful conduct.

In the. _Velmurugu case, (supra),_ at p. 224, Sharvananda, J. said :

" If the State invests one of its officers or agencies with power which is
capable of inflicting the deprivation complained of, it. is bound by the
exercise of such power even in abuse thereof; the official position makes the
abuse effective to achieve the flouting of the subject's fundamental rights.
The State had endowed the officer with coercive power, and his exercise of its
power, whether in conformity with or in disregard of fundamental rights
constitutes executive action. The official's act is ascribed to the State for
the purpose of determining responsibility, otherwise the constitutional
prohibition will have no meaning. "

Soza, J. in _Vivienne Goonewardene's_ case, (supra), at p. 437 cited and
followed Sharvananda, J.' s explanation, of the principles on which liability
for infringement of fundamental rights is imputed to the State.

Where there is. no express or implied authority, the act of a public officer
may nevertheless be regarded as executive or administrative action if it could
be inferred from the circumstances that the act was done with the intention of
doing good to the State and not for his own purposes. In such a case of
ostensible authority it may be no defence that the officer concerned was
acting beyond his power or authority and even in disregard of a prohibition or
special direction provided, of course, that the act was incidental to what the
officer was employed to do.

Wanasundera, J. in _Velmurugu's_ case _(supra),_ at p. 21 2 said :

" The liability in respect of subordinate officers should apply to all acts
done under colour of office, i.e., within the scope of their authority express
or implied, and should also extend #9;

**35**

to such other acts that may be _ultra vires_ and even in disregard of a
prohibition or special directions provided that they are done in furtherance
or supposed furtherance of their authority or done at least with the intention
of benefiting the State. "

I agree with my brother Fernando, J., for the reasons he has given, that the
Petitioner's attempt to show that the First Respondent was acting with the
intention of benefiting the State must fail. It was, I think, an ex post-facto
pretence on his part. Perhaps it was an inspired fabrication ?

My brother, Fernando, J. arrives at his decision on the question of
responsibility by way of the Law governing vicarious liability/and regards the
petitioner's rights to compensation as one of several common law rights in the
field of delict. This seems to have been the approach favoured by Lord
Hailsham of St. Marylebone in his dissenting judgment in _Maharaj_ v.
_Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago,_ (No. 2), [1978] 2 All E.R. 670
especially at p. 687 and p. 688 (1) However, our Court has preferred to treat
a violation of a fundamental right as something _sui generis_ created by the
Constitution and not as a delict. Their Lordships of the Supreme Court have
consistently steered away from the vicarious liability approach.

case, _(supra),_ at p. 210 Wanasundera, J. said :,

The learned Deputy Solicitor-General sought to advance his argument further by
relying on certain decisions relating to vicarious liability of a master for
the acts of his servant in the sphere of the law of tort. I am in agreement
with Mr. Pullenayagam that the test of liability formulated in those cases is
not an appropriate or safe test for application in the present case. We are
here dealing with the liability of the State under public law. which is a new
liability imposed directly on the State by the constitutional provisions.
While the decisions relating to the vicarious liability of a master

  **36**

for the acts of. his servant may be useful to the extent that all cases where
a master can be held liable in tort would undoubtedly fall also within the
liability of the State under the constitutional provisions, the converse need
not be true unless we are to give a restricted interpretation, to the
constitutional provisions. The common law test of tortuous liability therefore
cannot provide a sufficient test and we have to look elsewhere for the
appropriate "principles. "

Soza, J. in _Vivienne Goonewardene's_ case, _(supra),_ at p. 438 expressed a
similar view. He said :

The nature' of the liability has been neatly explained by Lord Diplock in the
Privy Council decision in _Maharaj_ v. _The Attorney-Genera I of Trinidad and
Tobago,_ No. 2 - [1979] A.C. 385, 399 (1) - .in the following words :

This is not vicarious liability it is a liability of the State itself. It is
not a liability in tort at all it is a liability in the public law of the
State which has been newly created.

Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone in his minority judgment in this case did not
agree with this formulation because he found it ' difficult to accommodate
within the concepts of the law a type of liability for damages for the wrong
of another when the wrongdoer himself is under no liability at all the wrong
itself is not a tort or delict. His Lordship found it equally difficult to
understand that this was some sort of primary liability. 'But what Lord
Diplock was emphasising was. that this was a new liability in public law
created by the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago, not to be considered from
the angle of the existing bases of liability. In Sri Lanka too our
Constitution has, created a new liability in public law.

This view is also supported by the decision of Sharvananda, J. (with whom
Ratwatte, J. agreed) in the _Velmurugu_ case (supra). In that case _(op. cit._
p. 224) Sharvananda, J. says :

_

_

**37**

_

" _It is to be noted that the claim for redress under Article 126 for what has
been done by an executive officer of the State is a claim against the State
for what has been done in the executive power of the State. This is not
vicarious liability it is not a liability in tort at all it is a liability in
the public law of the State - vide _(Maharaj v. Attorney General of Trinidad_
{1978] 2 AER 670 at 679 PC). "

These words were quoted with approval by Sharvananda, J. in _Mariadas Raj_ v.
_Attorney-General; and Another,_ (10).

In _Ganeshanathan v. Vivienne Goonewardene and Three Others,_ (40) Ranasinghe,
J. said :

The nature of the liability incurred upon an infringement of a fundamental
right by a State Officer and the real basis upon which relief or redress is
granted to him has been set down by Lord Diplock in the Privy Council in the
case of _Maharaj_ v. _The Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago_ as:

This is not vicarious liability, it is liability of the State itself. It is
not a liability in tort at all, it is the liability in the public law of the
State. This view of the underlying principle has also been hitherto followed
by this Court. "

The fact that the agent of the State is required by Rule 65 of the Supreme
Court Rules to be named in a petition for relief for violation of Fundamental
Rights is not an indication that the State is vicariously liable for the act
of the wrongdoer. The identity of the alleged transgressor is, as explained by
Ranasinghe, J. in the _Ganeshanathan_ case _(supra)_ at p. 351 in fin. - 352,
required for two purposes : (1) Before liability" is brought home to the
State, it is necessary for the aggrieved persons to establish that his
fundamental right has been infringed by an executive or administrative act.
Any such act has to be committed by a State Officer or by any other person who
could be held to be an organ of the State. It is only on

**38**

 account of such an act by such an individual that the liability cast upon the
State would arise. It is in recognition of this position and this principle
that Rules 65 (1) (a) and (b) and 65 (4) (n), in particular, have been framed
in the way they have been framed. " (2) The naming of the Respondent and his
presence in Court enables the State and the alleged wrongdoer, who will be
given particulars of the petitioner's claim, to defend themselves. (See also
per Samarakoon, C.J. in the _Ganeshanathan_ Case, _(supra),_ at p. 331).

This is all there is to it and as Ranasinghe, J. observed in _K. Visvalingam
and Others_ v. _Don John Francis Liyanage,_ (41)

The act or acts in respect of which relief is sought are acts of the officers
of the State. The relief granted in the ultimate analysis is an award against
the State. "

It is therefore the State that is Stable to pay compensation to the
Petitioner. (See _Vivienne Goonewardene_ v. _Hector Perera and Others_ (1
983), Fundamental Rights Decisions 426 at p. 440 ]8). Although in _Mariadas
Raj_ v. _Attorney-General and another,_ (1983), Fundamental Rights Decisions,
Vol. H, 397 Sharvananda, J. at p. 404 (10.) said that "The relief granted is
principally against the State, although the delinquent official may also be
directed to make amends and/or suffer punishment ", he went on to direct
_(ibid,_ p. 408) the State to pay compensation to the Petitioner. As
Wanasundera, J. said in _Ganeshanathan_ v. _Vivienne Goonewardene and Three
Others.

_

"A proceeding under Article 126 is against the State and the State has to bear
the liability for unlawful executive or administrative action. "

It was the State that was ordered to pay compensation in _Amal Sudath Silva_
v. _Kodituwakku, Inspector of Police and Others,_ (35). And so it was in
_Nallanayagam_ v. _Gunatillake and Others._ (1 5) and _semble_ in _E/more
Perera_ v. _Major Montague Jayawickrama and Others,_ 1 985 1 Sri LR. 285 per
Wimalaratne, J. at p. 364 and per Colin-Thome', J. at p. 390 (42), I am
conscious of the fact that in _Ratnasara Them_ v. _Udugampola,_ (11),
_Kapugeekiyana_

**39**

v. _Hettiarachchi,_ (6) and in _Rajaratne v. Air Lanka,_ (33) the awards were
against the agent of the State. However, I would, with great respect, prefer
to follow the decisions in _Vivienne Goonewardene, Mariadas Raj, Amal Sudath
Silva_ and _Nallanayagam_ and make order in this case with regard to the
payment of compensation against the State.

My brother Fernando, J. holds that the State and First Respondent be held
jointly and severally liable. This is the correct form of an order in an
action based on delict where joint tort-feasors are jointly and severally
liable for the whole damage, and taking the view he does of the nature of
fundamental rights actions, namely that they are delicts, he may, for the sake
of consistency, feel constrained to make the order in the form in which he
makes it. However, I do not find any decision in our Law Reports which
supports such a practice in relation to an award of relief made in terms of
Article 1 26 of the Constitution and making the State and First Respondent
jointly and severally liable is unnecessary in the context of the bases of
liability as I see them.

It is entirely consistent with the view that what is involved is State
liability that even where the agent of the State is mistakenly identified in
the Petition for redress to this- Court for an alleged violation of a
Fundamental Right, the State is nevertheless liable if it is established to
the satisfaction of the Court that the act in question was in fact done by a
State official. Hence, the fact that the wrong Secretary to a Ministry had
been named did not end the proceedings in _Katunayakage Damesius Perera and
Another_ v. _R. Premadasa and Others,_ (43). Nor did the fact that a police
officer other than the one named as a respondent was responsible for a
wrongful arrest or detention in violation of the Fundamental Rights of a
Petitioner, stand in the way of redress where the Court was satisfied that the
act was that of some Police Officer and, therefore, State action. (See per
Samarakoon, CJ. in _Ganeshanathan_ v. _Vivienne Goonewardene and three
Others,_ (40). See also _Mariadas Raj._ v. _Attorney General and Others,_
(10).

If a right created by the Constitutions of 1972 and 1978 is _sui_

**40**

_generis,_ does it mean that an old right under the law co-exists ? In the
_Kapugeekiyana_ case at p. 166 Wimalaratne, J. said that the rights of
suspects already enjoyed by them " have now been made constitutional rights. "
And Soza, J. in _Vivienne Goonewardene_ v. _Hector Perera and Others,_ (8)
says :

Fundamental rights were secured and guaranteed even in the 1972 Constitution
but no special machinery for enforcement was provided. The Constitution of 1
978 spells out in detail the Fundamental Rights it recognises and it has
provided a special forum and special machinery for enforcement and for the
grant of relief and redress. But the old forms of procedure and the old
remedies still co-exist with the new. "

Does it mean that now, in certain circumstances, there are two remedies, one,
a remedy in the sphere of public law and another in the sphere of public? Is
it open to a party to obtain relief under both remedies? It is interesting to
note in this connection that the Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago, which
was the subject of interpretation in the _Maharaj case,_ (supra), and quoted
by Wanasundera, J. in the Velmurugu case, (supra), at p. 201 _fin_ expressly
provides in Article 6.11 that the Constitutional Rights are " without
prejudice to any other action with respect to the same matter which is
lawfully available. "

If two remedies are available in our law also, what is the effect on the
_quantum_ of compensation ? The provisions of the Constitution are supposed to
provide a speedy and efficacious remedy. (See _Palihawadana_ v. _Attorney-
General and Others._ (44) _Velmurugu's_ case, (supra), at 223). The remedy is
speedy because the short time limits prescribed by the Constitution are
rigidly enforced. (See _Edirisuriya_ v. _Navaratnam and Others,_ (45) K.S.S.E.
_Ranatunge_ v. _A.R.M. Jayewardene and Others,_ at p. 80 (46)
_Thadchanamoorthi's_ case, _(supra)_ at p. 134 fin _Jayewardene_ v. _Attorney-
General and Others._ (47) _Vivienne Goonewardene_ v. _Hector Perera and
Others, (supra)_ at p. 440 _Jayanetti's_ case, _(supra)_ at p. 192
_Siriwardene_ v. _Rodrigo,_ (48); _Viswalingam_ v. _Liyanage and Others_ (49).
However, a speedy remedy may not be always the most efficacious.

**41**

If the proceedings in this Court are final and preclude further proceedings
elsewhere, would it not be unfair by a party whose damages cannot be assessed
within the time prescribed by the Constitution for hearing and determining
these matters ? And what of prospective loss ?

These are questions, and no doubt there are necessarily others, that have not
been discussed before us in this case, and without the benefit of a sufficient
argument by Counsel I am, naturally, reluctant to express even a tentative
opinion. If Pandora's box is to be opened, J should, with great respect, in
the name of Hope remaining, submit that a fuller bench be invited to consider
the remedies for the ills that might have escaped. For the purpose of guiding
me to a decision in the present case. I think the principles enunciated by
this Court, and the helpful _dicta_ that have been expressed from time to
time, are more than sufficient, and I do not wish to wittingly depart from
them. Nor do I wish to make large generalisations about such principles and
_dicta_ because no light I think will be shed on this case by doing so.
Indeed, it may be improper for me to do so (Cf. per Dixori. J. in _Victoria
Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co._ v. _Jay/or_ (50).

I must now turn to the question of compensation. Lord Evershed, MR in _Nimno-
Smith_ y. _Burgess Garages Ltd., and London County Council,_ (1958)-CA quoted
in Kemp and Kemp, _The Quantum of Damages,_ 1961, -2nd Edn. Vol. I at p. 159
observed that-

"The subject-matter of estimation is very much what might be called a series
of imponderables ; and that; of course, makes anything in the way of an
assertion about what the right figure is a precarious matter. "

I make no assertion about the total sum decided upon by my brother Fernando,
J. I agree that a sum of Rs. 15,000 should be awarded to the petitioner.

Some amount it seems must be awarded if there has been an infringement of a
Fundamental Right which is regarded as a

**42**

delict. Even nominal damages must be awarded in a case of injury without
damage - _injuria sine damnum,_ for it is practically the only judgment that
is appropriate in such a ease, although admittedly in technical terms the law
requires not damage but an _injuria_ or wrong on which to base a judgment for
the plaintiff. " (See Mayne and McGregor on Damages, 12th Edition, at p. 1 91
_et seq.).

_

However, if the violation of Fundamental Rights constitutes non-delictual
wrongs, then damages need not be awarded in certain cases. And, indeed, our
Court has sometimes declared a violation to have taken place and ordered
something to be done or not to be done or declared something to be the case as
the relief it grants under Article 1 26. This was what Wanasundera, J.
proposed in the _E/more Perera_ case at p. 342 _fin. -_ 343\. This was also
the relief in _Laxamana and. Others_ v. _G.P.S. Weerasooriya, General Manager
of Railways and Another,_ (52); _Perera_ v. _University Grants Commission,_
(12) and _Eheliyagoda .and Others_ v. _Janatha Estate Development Board,_ (1
3). It was also the case in _Jayanetti v. The Land Reform Commission,_ (32)
and in _Gooneratne and Others_ v. _Chandrananda de Silva, Commissioner of
Elections,_ (53).

When, in an appropriate case, compensation _is_ awarded for the violation of a
Fundamental Right, it is, I think, by way of an acknowledgement of regret and
a _solatium_ for the hurt caused by the violation of a fundamental right and
not as a punishment for duty disregarded or authority abused. (Cf. per Lord
Carmont in _M'Leish_ v. _Fulton and Sons,_ (54) and _We/d-Blundell_ v.
_Stephens_ (55).

Even if the act were a delict, punishment is an irrelevant consideration. The
cases point to a rationale not of punishment of the defendant but of extra
compensation for the plaintiff for the injury to his feelings and "dignity. In
_Cassell & Co. Ltd. _v. _Broome & Another, _(56) Lord Diplock said :

In common law weapons to curb abuse of power by the executive had not been
forged by the mid-eighteenth century: In view of the developments,
particularly in the last

**43**

 20 years, in adapting the old remedies by prerogative writ and declaratory
action to check unlawful abuse of power by the executive, the award of
exemplary damages in civil actions for tort against individual government
servants seems a blunt instrument to use for this purpose today. "

Civil action are concerned with reparation rather than punishment (See
_Rookes_ v. _Bernard,_ (57) _Fielding and Another_ v. _Variety Incorporated,_
(58) and per Scarman L.J. also at p. 500 _in fin_ ; and the _CasselI's_ case,
_(supra)._ In a case such as this where the First Respondent was guilty of
outrageous behavior, it is not a punitive element that must enter into the
enhancement of compensation payable,' but the need to assuage the Petitioner's
hurt feelings by a recognition of the enormity of the wrong complained of.
What is sought to be done by increasing the amount of the award is to give the
Petitioner the consolation of knowing that this Court acknowledges the
seriousness of the harm done and that it has tried to establish some
reasonable relation between the wrong done and the _solatium_ applied. (Cf.
per Hamilton L.J. in _Greenlands_ v. _Wilmshurst_ (59).

It is the Petitioner's point of view that is relevant. Thus in the _Velmurugu_
case, _(supra),_ Sharvananda, J. commented oh the fact that the case disclosed
" a shocking and revolting episode in law enforcement " and ordered the State
to pay compensation " for the distress, humiliation and suffering undergone by
the Petitioner " as a result of the cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment
meted out to him.

As far as the delinquent officer himself is concerned, the Court may, in an
appropriate case, as it did in _Vivienne Goonewardene_ v. _Hector Perera and
Others, (supra),_ at p. 440 and as Sharvananda and Ratwatte J.J. did in the
_Velmurugu_ case, _(Supra)_ at. p. 242 direct the authorities concerned to
take disciplinary action. Such action has been already taken in the case
before us and therefore we make no direction with regard to that matter.

In Daramitipola Ratnasara Thero v. P. Udugampola and others,

**44**

(11) Abdul Cader, J., (Wimalaratne, Ratwatte, Colin-Thome and Rodrigo JJ.
agreeing) said :

In my view this is a serious violation of the fundamental rights of a citizen
of this country which-calls for the award of substantial damages. A mere
declaration without more in the form of some penalty . . . will not deter such
future abuse of fundamental rights of citizens."

With the greatest respect I am unable to agree that deterrence is a relevant
element in the assessment of compensation in a Fundamental Rights action.
Being as they are actions against the State, an attempt by this Court to
punish the State would, I think, be imprudently venturesome. To attempt to
deter it would be hopelessly futile, for the State, in truth, I believe, has a
long pocket, the depths of which we must know, if we are to make a meaningful,
punitive award. It is extemely unlikely that we shall ever know the deepness
of the treasury pocket and it is therefore hardly ever likely that we would be
so placed as to make a proper assessment of punitive damages. It behoves us
also to be mindful of the fact that large awards will only increase the burden
of the tax-payer and that of the ordinary man in the street to whom the burden
of the tax-payer will, lamentably, be passed on' eventually. Therefore, we
need to act with restraint in awarding compensation in these matters.

The variety of the matters we have to consider in assessing damages for a
violation of fundamental rights means that a verdict in such a case with
regard to the amount to be awarded is the product of a mixture of inextricable
considerations and, therefore, in expressing it a separate assessment of the
various elements, ought not to be mad-e or disclosed. (Cf. per Vindeyer, J. in
_Uren_ v. _John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd., _(60) quoted with approval by Lord
Hailsham in _Cassell & Co. Ltd. _v. _Broome and Another_ (56), Lord Hailsham
_(ibid)_ said :

" The next point to notice is that it has always been a principle in English
Law that the award of damages when awarded must be a single lump sum in
respect of each separate cause of action. Of course, where part of the

**45**

 damage can be precisely calculated, it is possible and desirable to isolate
part of it in the same cause of action. It is also possible and desirable to
isolate different sums of damages receivable in different torts .... But I
must say I view with distrust the arbitrary subdivision of different elements
of general damages for the same tort . . . In cases where the award of general
damages contains a subjective element, I do not believe it is desirable or
even possible simply to add separate sums together for different parts of the
subjective element, especially where  the subjective element relate under
different heads to the same factor, in this case the bad conduct of the
defendant. I would think with Lord Atkin in _Ley_ v. _Hamilton_ (61):

The punitive element is not something which is or _can_ (the italics are mine)
be added to some known factor which is non-punitive. "

In other words the whole process of assessing damages where they are " at
large " is essentially a matter of impression and not addition. When exemplary
damages are involved, and even though, in theory at least, it may be possible
to winnow out the purely punitive element, the danger of double counting by a
jury or a judge are so great that, even to avoid a new trial, I would have
thought of the dangers usually outweighed the advantages. "

For the reasons stated in my judgment, I make order as follows :

(1) The First Respondent acting within the scope of his duties and acting
within his powers violated the fundamental rights o1 the Petitioner guaranteed
by Article 11 of the Constitution by subjecting him to cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment ;

(1) The State shall be liable to pay a sum of Rs. 1 5,000 to the Petitioner
byway of compensation ;

**46**

(3) Costs shall be paid as ordered by my brother, Fernando, J.
