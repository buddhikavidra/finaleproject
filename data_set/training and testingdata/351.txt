SUPREME COURT

S.C. APPEAL NO. 71/95  
CA APPEAL NO. 33/84 (F)  
DC. PANADURA NO. 17380 21  
JULY, 1997.  
  
_Landlord and Tenant - Consolidation of property - S. 166 of the Urban
Councils Ordinance read with S. 233 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance -
Excepted premises - Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 - 3rd regulation in the schedule to
the Act.  
_  
The plaintiff filed action against the defendant on 22.7.1981 for ejectment
from premises No. 318. The assessment unit 318 was created in October 1980
when the Urban Council action under S. 166 of the Urban Councils Ordinance and
S. 233 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance consolidated premises Nos. 318, 320
and 322 which were business premises under the Rent Act of which the defendant
had been the tenant from 1960. The consolidation was without the knowledge or
consent of the defendant and the new assessment was cancelled on a complaint
made by the defendant after the institution of the action. The trial proceeded
on the basis of one unit of assessment as the rights of parties had to be
decided as at the date of the action. After consolidation, the new unit was
given the value of Rs. 3,750/- which value made the premises excepted premises
in terms of the schedule to the Rent Act.  
  
**Held:  
**  
The entry in the assessment register will bind the landlord and the tenant
only if they were parties to the inquiry before the local authority. The
consolidation of three units into one unit was without the knowledge of the
tenant. Hence the earlier three units continued to be three separate units for
the purposes of the Rent Act despite consolidation and new assessment at the
time of the institution of the action, and therefore, the premises in suit
continued to be governed by the Rent Act.

_Cur. adv. vult._

9th October 1997  
  
**ANANDACOOMARASWAMY, J.  
**  
This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Special Leave to
Appeal was granted on the following two questions:  
  
1\. Whether the decision of the Court of Appeal that the premises in dispute
are excepted premises is correct having regard inter alia to section 233 (1)
of the Municipal Councils Ordinance?  
  
2\. Whether in applying the provisions of the Rent Act the consolidated
assessment in terms of section 233 (1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance
could be ignored?  
  
The facts relevant to this appeal are briefly as follows:-

**83**

The plaintiff-appellant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff)
instituted this action to eject the defendant-respondent-appellant
(hereinafter referred to as the defendant) from the premises bearing
assessment No. 318, Main Street, Panadura.  
  
The defendant's stepfather became the tenant of premises bearing assessment
Nos. 304, 306, 308, Main Street, Panadura, on or about 1942 and ran a business
in the said premises.  
  
After his death in 1960 the defendant became the tenant of these premises and
ran a ceramic shop, a banana shop and a hotel and bakery, respectively in the
separate premises.  
  
Later these numbers were changed to assessment Nos. 318, 320 and 322.  
  
In October, 1980 the Urban Council made the said three premises one assessment
unit (No. 318) as a business premises with an annual value of Rs. 3,750/-.  
  
The defendant came to know of this on or about 27.04.1981 about 11 days after
the notice to quit and by document marked V3' requested the Chairman, Urban
Council, Panadura, to renumber the premises as it was earlier.  
  
The plaintiff then filed action on 22.07.1981 to eject the defendant from the
new premises No. 318 on the ground that the premises were not governed by the
Rent Act as they were excepted premises under the 3rd regulation in the
schedule to the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972.  
  
The defendant made representation against the consolidation of the three units
into one unit to the Chief Valuer. Ultimately by P6 dated 13.08.1981, the
Chief Valuer directed that the consolidation be cancelled and the original
assessed units of Nos. 318, 320 and 322 be restored. The trial proceeded on
the basis that there was one unit of assessment, as the rights of parties had
to be decided as at the date of the institution of the action, but the learned
District Judge had gone on the correspondence that passed between the Chief
Valuer and the Chairman of the Urban Council although the entry in the
assessment register of Rs. 3,750/- for the unit No. 318.remained unchanged
when the action was filed.

**84**

The first issue raised by the plaintiff at the trial was whether these
premises were governed by the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972. At the trial it
transpired that there were three units Nos. 318, 320 and 322 in existence and
have been valued for purpose of rates long prior to the year 1968, and in 1974
the annual value was raised to Rs.1,750/-, Rs.1,000/-, Rs.1,000/- respectively
in respect of the said premises. These amounts were in existence until
October, 1980 when the U. C. without notice to the defendant consolidated the
three premises into one and gave a value of Rs. 3,750/- which is an aggregate
sum of the amounts stated earlier in this paragraph and for the first time
taking the annual value of the consolidated premises above the relevant amount
in the schedule to the Rent Act and thus taking the premises out of the Rent
Act.  
  
After trial the Learned District Judge held in favour of the defendant, that
the property was governed by the Rent Act. In appeal to the Court of Appeal,
the Court of Appeal held in favour of the plaintiff on the ground that the
consolidation of the three units into one and the aggregate sum of the sums
for the three units raised the annual value of the consolidated premises above
the relevant amount in the schedule to the Rent Act and thus taking the
premises out of the Rent Act. The appeal to this court is from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal.  
  
The question before this court is whether the assessment of the consolidated
unit of the three earlier units in October, 1980 at Rs. 3,750/- was an
assessment for the first time.  
  
Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that consolidation does not give
birth to a new premises unless there are structural changes or improvements or
alterations of a substantial nature. On the other hand, learned counsel for
the plaintiff submitted that once the earlier units are consolidated into one
unit with a new assessment, it is that assessment which is material for the
purpose of Rent Act and not the assessment of the earlier unit, because only
the new assessment is entered in the assessment register and the landlord and
the tenant are bound by the entries in the assessment register. It is not
possible to hark back to the assessment of the three earlier units prior to
October, 1980. Further, the authorised rent has to be calculated according to
section 4 of the Rent Act, namely:

**85**

(a) Annual value in 1955, plus,  
  
(b)  Rates for the particular year.  
  
Therefore if it is necessary to calculate the separate authorised rent for
January, 1981 of No. 318 or 320 or 322, it is not possible to do so as there
is no separate rate for No. 318 or 320 or 322, as all three have been
consolidated. If there is no separate rate for premises controlled by the Rent
Act, then the Rent Act becomes unworkable.  
  
This question for adjudication by this court arose more than three decades
ago.  
  
It was held in the case of Chettinard Corporation v. Gamage (1) that whatever
be the result of the consolidated assessment and the alÂ­teration of the number
of premises the earlier annual value of the premises before consolidation
prevails.  
  
A similar view was taken in the case of Sally Mohamed v. Syed Mohamed (2).  
  
In the case of Premadasa v. Atapattu (3) a different view was taken. This was
a case where an earlier existing premises was subsequently divided and
assessed separately. The Court distinguishing the Chettinard Corporation Ltd.
case (supra) held that the division created a new premises. It was further
held in the Chettinard Corporation Ltd. case (supra) that the premises in
question was in existence as separate entities. In this case the unit in
question was not in existence prior to the second assessment:  
  
In the case of Ansar v. Hussain (4) Wanasundera J., reviewed these cases and
took a third view which was followed in Hewavitharane v. Ratnapala.(5) In that
case it was decided that where separate existing premises which had an
assessment as at 1st January 1968 are consolidated and subsequently assessed
as one entity, the new assessment would apply only if a new premises has in
fact come into being due to the physical alterations done to the separate
units.  
  
Weerasena v. Perera (6) was also a case where premises let was subsequently
divided and assessed separately and in the absence of physical alterations it
was held that a new premises had not come into being.

**86**

The above decisions were followed in Withanagamage v. Jothipala and Two
others, (7) Daluwatte v. Premalatha,(9) D. N. Udeshi v. Mather (10) and
Wakkumbura v. Nandawathie.(11)  
  
In Wakkumbura case (supra) it was held "minor changes such as sub-division and
assessment or consolidation and assessment have no impact on the valuation and
assessments (Ansar v. Hussain (supra)) unless there is a significant
structural or other changes of a similar nature (Hewavitharana v. Ratnapala
(supra)). What is protected is the contract of tenancy and not the premises
(Imbuldeniya v. De Silva"" and Weerasena v. Perera (supra))".  
  
Learned Counsel for the plaintiff relied on the decision C. Rajakaruna v.
Laura de Silva" (12) where it was held that in a rent and ejectment case, the
Court, the landlord and tenant are bound by entries in the assessment
Register.  
  
That was the decision by Samarawickrama, J. in an appeal to the Supreme Court
from a judgment of the Court of Requests, Colombo. In view of the several
decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, **the decision in C.
Rajakaruna case (supra) can no longer be regarded as a binding authority.  
**  
The entry in the Assessment Register will bind the landlord and the tenant
only if they were parties to the inquiry into the objection against the
assessment before the local authority.  
  
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that if the three units are conÂ­solidated
and assessment made and entered in the register there would be no separate
assessment for the three earlier units entered in the Assessment Register and
therefore the calculation of the authorised rent is not possible. The answer
to this question is in the proviso to section 233 (1) of the Municipal
Councils Ordinance which reads thus:  
  
"The Council may from time to time as often as it may think necessary for the
purpose of assessment divide any house, buildÂ­ings, lands or tenements
whatsoever within the Municipality and assess in respect of any rate or rates
leviable under this Ordinance, each such divided portion separately and each
such consolidated premises as a whole:

**87**

Provided that in the case of any such consolidation the consolidated premises
shall be assessed at the aggregate annual value of the several houses,
buildings, lands or tenements of which such premises are composed".  
  
Therefore if several premises are consolidated into one unit it is possible to
ascertain the assessment of each separate unit, as the assessment of the new
consolidated unit is the aggregate of the annual value of the several units.  
  
Therefore the contention of learned counsel for plaintiff that the Rent Act
becomes unworkable cannot be sustained.  
  
In the instant case the three units were consolidated into one unit without
the knowledge and/or consent of the tenant and after the institution of the
action the new assessment was cancelled on a complaint by the defendant
(tenant) after the institution of the action. This also goes to show that the
entry in the Assessment Register is only prima facie valid.  
  
For these reasons these earlier three units continue to be three separate
units for the purposes of the Rent Act, despite consolidation and new
assessment at the time of the institution of the action, and therefore the
premises in suit continue to be governed by the Rent Act.  
  
For these reasons I allow the appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 10,500/-.  
  
The judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and the judgment of the
District Court is restored for the reasons adduced above.  
  
**G. P. S. DE SILVA, CJ. - I agree.  
  
 BANDARANAYAKE, J. - I agree.  
  
_Appeal allowed._**
