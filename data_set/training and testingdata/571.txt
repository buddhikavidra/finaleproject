_Constitutional Law - Article 125 of the Constitution - Jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal under Article 138(1) of the Constitution to entertain an
appeal from a decision of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of
the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 154P(3)(b) of the
Constitution -Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.  
  
_The Magistrate convicted the accused-appellant (the accused) for
contraven­tion of a regulation published in the Gazette dated 26.3.1992 and
ordered a fine and the forfeiture of 75 cubic feet of timber from the accused.
The accused appealed to the High Court under the Code of Criminal Procedure
Act. The appeal was dismissed. From that order the accused sought to appeal to
the Court of Appeal. The question arose whether in view of section 9 of the
High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, the
Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under Article 138 of
the Constitution, read with Article 154P(6) of the Constitution.  
  
It was argued that the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court have concur­rent
jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the Provincial High Court.

**Held:  
  
**1\. Article 138(1) is an enabling provision which distinctly states that:  
  
"The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the
Constitution or of any law an appellate jurisdiction............. "  
  
2\. The Court of Appeal does not have appellate jurisdiction under Article
138(1) of the Constitution read with Article 154(P) 6 in respect of the
decisions of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction and it is the Supreme Court that

March 30, 2004 **SHIRANI BANDARANAYAKE, J.  
**  
The Court of Appeal has referred this matter in terms of Articles 125 of the
Constitution as it involves interpretation of the provisions of the
Constitution.  
  
The question in issue relates to a matter, where the accused-appellant-
appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was charged in the
Magistrate's Court of Ampara having contravened Regulation 4 of Gazette No. 01
of 1992 dated 26.03.1992. The Magistrate by his order, dated 02.05.1995
convicted the accused and sentenced him to a fine of Rs. 100,000/-. Further,
2000 cubic centimeters (75 cubic feet) of timber he had under his control was
confiscated. From that order the appellant appealed to the High

**259**

Court in terms of Article 154 and section 320 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. The Judge of the High Court, by his order dated
30.05.1996, dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence.
Thereafter the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the order of
the High Court in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution.

  
In the Court of Appeal, learned Senior State Counsel for the complainant-
respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) took up a
preliminary objection that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal preferred by the appellant as it is a matter that has to
be referred to the Supreme Court in terms of section 9 of the High Court of
the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 1990. Accordingly the Court of
Appeal referred to following question to be considered by the Supreme Court.

"Does the Court of Appeal have appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article
138(1) of the Constitution read with Article 154(P) 6 in respect of decisions
of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its - appellate
jurisdiction, or is it the Supreme Court that has jurisdiction in appeals from
the Provincial High Court as set out in section 9 of the High Courts of the
Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990."\-  
  
Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Court of
Appeal as well as the Supreme Court will have con­current jurisdiction to hear
and determine appeals from the Provincial High Court in the exercise of
appellate jurisdiction.

The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appel­lant was that
in terms of Article 154(P) 6 of the Constitution, a person who is aggrieved by
a decision of the Provincial High Court would have a right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal. Learned President's Counsel submitted that in terms of the
amendment to Article 138 of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal could hear
an appeal from the High Court of the Provinces, "in the exercise of its
appellate or original jurisdiction". In support of this contention, learned
President's Counsel cited the decision in Abeygunasekera v SetungaW and
Sumanadasa v Hathurusinghe(2).

**260**

Article 138 of the Constitution provides for the appellate juris­diction to
the Court of Appeal. In terms of Article 138(1) of the  Constitution,

> "The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of
> the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction
> of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by any Court of
> First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive
> cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all
> causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such Court
> of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:  
>  
>  Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be reversed
> or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not
> prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a fail­ure of
> justice."

Article 138 of the Constitution was amended by the Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution by the substitution of the words "committed by any Court of First
Instance" of the words "committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its
appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance," thus
incorporating the decisions of the High Court in the exercise of its appellate
or original jurisdiction, being amenable to the appellate jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal.  
  
The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution enabled the High Courts to be
established in the provinces by virtue of Article 154(P) of the Constitution.
However, no provision was made with regard to the procedure to be followed in
such High Courts. In order to pro­vide for the lacuna in the law with regard
to the procedure to be fol­lowed in at the High Court of the Provinces, the
High Court of the 80 Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990 was
enacted which made provision "regarding the procedure to be followed in, and
the right to appeal to and from, the High Court established under Article
154(P) of the Constitution".  
  
This Act also made provision for the appeals to be brought in

**261**

before the Court of Appeal as well as the Supreme Court from the High Court.
Whilst section 9 of the Act refers to appeals to Supreme Court from High
Court, section 11 provides for appeals to Court of Appeal from the High Court.  
  
Section 9 of the Act is in the following terms:  
  
"Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person aggrieved
by-

  
(a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by
Article 154(P) of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate
jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) of Article 145(P) of the
Constitution or section 3 of this Act or any other law, in any matter or
proceeding whether civil or criminal which involves a substantial question of
law, may appeal there \- from to the Supreme Court if the High Court grants
leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex mero motu or at the instance of any
aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:. "  
  
Article 154(P)(3) of the Constitution refers to the power of the High Court
and paragraph 3(b) of the said Article reads as follows:  
  
"Notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law, exercise,
appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences
and orders entered or imposed by Magistrate's Courts and 110 Primary Courts
within the Province;"  
  
Section 11 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) Act, No. 19
of 1990 on the other hand refers to para­graph 3(a) or 4 of Article 154(P) of
the Constitution.  
  
Paragraph 3(a) of Article 154P of the Constitution reads as follows:

"Every such High Court shall -  
  
(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of the High
Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed within the Province;"

**262**

Learned President's Counsel for the accused-appellant in his submission relied
on the decision in Abeygunasekera v Setunga (supra) and Sumandasa v
Hathurusinghe (Supra) where the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal
respectively had taken the view that the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction
to hear an appeal against a decision of the High Court whether by way of
appeal or revision.  
  
Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear an appeal was derived in terms of
Article 138 read with Article 154(P) (6) of the 130 Constitution. Article
154(P)(6) states that,

> "Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any person
> aggrieved by a final order, judgement or sentence of any such Court, in the
> exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4) may
> appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138".

The decision in Abeygunasekera's case (supra) was based on the premise that
the authority to entertain appeal in terms of Article 154(P)(6) is restricted
under Article 138 of the Constitution, which spells out the jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeal and the manner of its exercise.  
  
It has been decided by this Court that Article 138 which creates and grants
jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to hear appeals from Courts of First
Instance, Tribunals and other Institutions is an enabling provision (Martin v
Wijewardane(3)- Further the decisions in Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd. v
Thantrige Dayaratne(4) and Weragama v Eksath Lanka Wathu Kamkaru Sangamaya and
oth-ers (5) clearly referred to the fact that the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction as this Article is
"subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law".  
  
An enabling provision, permits the omitted details of importance to be carried
out by means of a subsequent provision provided for that purpose. Bindra in
his work in Interpretation of Statutes (Eight Edition, pg. 651) citing
Thottuvarambath Velayudhan v Pottanyil Abuoobacker Haji(6) states that,  
  
"... if a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling

**263**

something to be done, but omits to mention in terms of some details of great
importance (if not actually essential) to the proper and effectual performance
of the work which the statute has in contemplation, it is beyond doubt that
Courts are at liberty to infer that the statute by necessary implication
empowers that the details be carried out."  
  
Therefore the jurisdiction granted to Court of Appeal in terms of
constitutional provisions could be exercised, in terms of the provi­sions of a
subsequent amendment. The Thirteenth Amendment which brought in a new judicial
dimension to the then existing judi­cial structure did not vary this situation
as similar provisions were adopted in Article 154(P)(6) where it states that
"subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law", an appeal could
be lodged in the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138\. The
addition­al provisions, which were necessary for the effective functioning of
the High Courts of the Provinces were brought in by way of the Special
Provisions Act, No. 19 of 1990.  
  
Accordingly, the right of appeal to and from the High Courts established under
Article 154(P) of the Constitution will have to be decided in terms of the
provisions enlisted in High Court of the  Provinces (Special Provisions) Act,
No. 19 of 1990, as provided by Article 138 as well as Article 154(P)(6) of the
Constitution.  
  
As adverted to earlier sections 9 and 11 refer to the appeals to the Supreme
Court and the Court of Appeal respectively from the High Court of the
Provinces. Section 10 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)
Act, No. 19 of 1990 which deal with the powers of the Supreme Court on
appeals, clearly states that the Supreme Court would exercise appellate
jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3)(b) of Article 154(P) of the
Constitution or section 3 of the aforementioned Act.  
  
It is to be noted that Article 154(3)(b) of the Constitution of which
reference is made in section 9 of High Court of the Provinces (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, provides for the appellate as well as
revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sen­tences and orders
entered or imposed by Magistrate's Courts and Primary Courts within the
Province. However, section 9 of the High

**264**

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act does not make ref­erence to
revisionary jurisdiction and deals only with appellate jurisdiction.

Unlike an appeal which could be made by any party who is dis­satisfied with
any judgment, decree or order pronounced in a Lower Court except when such
right is expressly disallowed, the power in revision is an extra ordinary
power which is quite distinct from the appellate jurisdiction. In Marian
Beebee v Seyed Mohamed(7) Sansoni, C.J., delivering the majority decision of
the Divisional Bench stated that,

> "The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent
> of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is
> the due administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes
> committed by the Court itself, in order to avoid miscarriages of justice, it
> is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his own motion, when an aggrieved
> per­son who may not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact
> that unless the power is exercised injus­tice will result."

In Gunaratne v Thambinayagam and others(8) the question that had to be decided
was whether there is a right of appeal from the High Court to the Supreme
Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. This Court after
considering the applicability of Articles 154(P)(3)(b), 154(P)(6) and sections
9 and 12 of the Act, No. 19 of 1990 correctly decided that section 9 of the
Act, No.19 of 1990 does not give a right of appeal to the Supreme Court from
an order of the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.  
  
In Abeygunasekera v Setunga and others (supra) the question in issue was
whether the Court of Appeal has the appellate juris­diction in terms of
Article 138(1) of the Constitution as amended by the Thirteenth Amendment in
respect of a decision of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its
revisionary jurisdiction.  
  
After considering Articles 154(P)(3), 154(P)(6) 138(1) of the Constitution and
section 9 of Act, No. 19 of 1990, Kulatunga, J. held that the Court of Appeal
had jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a decision of the High Court
whether given by way of appeal or revision.

**265**

Discussing the aforementioned provisions in the Constitution and the Act,
Kulatunga, J. was of the view that,

> "It is thus clear that the expression 'appellate jurisdiction' in section 9
> of Act, No. 19 of 1990 has a restricted meaning. If so, this Court cannot
> enlarge the right of appeal granted by that section. It is a matter for
> Parliament. As such, I am unable to agree that the case of Gunaratne v
> Thambinayagam (supra) has been wrongly decided. In the instant case, we are
> not concerned with the question whether a statutory right of appeal granted
> by ordinary law is subject to any limitation. The question is here is
> whether the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article
> 138(1) of the Constitution to entertain appeals made in terms of Article
> 154(P)(6) is restricted and excludes the power to entertain appeals from
> revisionary orders of the High Court. If it is so restricted then, it also
> means that the right of appeal granted by Article 154(P)(6) is restricted by
> Article 138(1)."

The Court of Appeal in Sumanadasa v Hathurusinghe (supra) had not taken into
consideration the applicability of Article 125 where the Supreme Court has the
sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to
the interpretation of the Constitution.  
  
In Abeygunasekera's Case (supra) Kulatunga, J. has taken the view that Article
154(P)(6) itself has not limited the right of appeal given by it to orders
made by the High Court by way of appeal, but that Article 154(p)(6) refers
back to Article 138 which spells out the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal
and the manner of its exercise.  
  
Be that as it may, it is to be borne in mind that Article 138 is an enabling
provision, which distinctly states that,  
  
"The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the
Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction... (emphasis added)."  
  
More importantly, in Abeygunasekera's case the Court was of the view that the
expression "appellate jurisdiction" in section 9 of

**266**

Act, No. 19 of 1990 has only a restricted meaning and therefore no
consideration was given to the applicability and the effect of section 9 of
the High Court of the Provinces Act, No. 19 of 1990.  
  
As has been adverted to earlier, High Court of the Provinces (Special
Provision) Act came into being in 1990 to make provision regarding the
procedure to be followed in and the right to appeal to and from the High Court
established under Article 154(P) of the Constitution.  
  
Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provision) Act, No. 19
of 1990 clearly specifies that any person aggrieved by a final order,
judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court estab­lished by Article 154(P) of
the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction in terms of
Article 154(P)(3)(b) of the Constitution or section 3 of the Act or any other
law whether it is civil or criminal which involves a substantial question of
law could appeal to the Supreme Court. Therefore it is of vital importance
that in deciding the appellate jurisdiction from an order of the High Court,
due consideration should be given to the provisions in sec­tion 9 of Act, No.
19 of 1990.  
  
It is to be noted that the provisions in Article 154(P)(3)(b) and Article
154(P)(6) of the Constitution and the provisions in section 9 of Act, No. 19
of 1990 provides for a right of appeal from an order of the High Court to the
Provinces. The cumulative effect of the provisions of Article 154(P)(3)(b),
154(P)(6) and section 9 of Act, No. 19 of 1990 is that there is a right of
appeal to the Supreme Court from the High Court established in terms of
Article 154(P) of the Constitution in, the exercise of the appellate
jurisdiction. In fact in Abeywardane v Ajith de Silva (9) a five Judge Bench
of this Court, while deciding that a direct appeal does not lie to the Supreme
Court from the order of the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary
jurisdiction, stated that,

> "The cumulative effect of the provisions of Articles 154(P)(3)(b), 154(P)(6)
> and section 9 of Act, No. 19 of 300 1990 is that, **while there is right of
> appeal to the Supreme Court from the orders, etc, of the High Court
> established by Article 154(P) of the Constitution in the exercise of the
> appellate jurisdiction**

**267**

> **vested in it by Article 154(P)(3)(b) or section 3 of Act, No. 19 of 1990
> or any other law**. there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court from
> the orders in the exercise of the **revisionary jurisdiction** (emphasis
> added)."

For the foregoing reasons, the question referred to this Court by 310 the
Court of Appeal is answered as follows:  
  
"The Court of Appeal does not have appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article
138(1) of the Constitution read with Article 154(6) in respect of decisions of
the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction
and it is the Supreme Court that has the jurisdiction in respect of appeals
from the Provincial High Court as set out in section 9 of the High Court of
the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.  In all the
circumstances of this case, there will be no costs.
