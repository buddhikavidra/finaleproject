**The relief sought by the petitioners in this application was that 01 the 1st

to complete their practicals and projects. Further to certain undertakings
given to Court, these reliefs have been obtained by the petitioners. However,
although the grievances of the petitioners have been remedied, they had to
incur expense in Coming to Court. We therefore award 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7
petitioners compensation in a sum of Rs. 2000/- each and costs in a sum of Rs.
5000/- payable 10 by the State on or before 31.01.2004

  
**WIGNESWARAN, J,   \- I agree.  
**  
**J.A.N. DE SILVA, J. - I agree.**

_**Relief granted.**_  
  
January 20, 2004 **FERNANDO, J.**

Subsequent to the proceedings of 21.11.2003, the petitioners have filed an
application for review of the above order, urging that this Court "made no
order in respect of the prayer for a declaration that the fundamental rights
of the petitioners guaranteed by Article 12(1) had been infringed", and
praying also for compensation in respect of such infringement.

The above order did recognize that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th
petitioners had a legitimate grievance, which had been remedied, but failed to
award compensation for the infringement of 20 their rights under Article
12(1). We accordingly vary the last sen­tence of the above order, which will
now read:

"However, although the grievances of the petitioners have been remedied, they
had to incur expense in coming to court. We award each of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
5th, 6th and 7th petitioners (a) compensation in a sum or Rs. 7,500/- and (b)
costs in a sum of Rs. 5,000/-payable by the State on or before 29.2.2004".

**WIGNESWARAN. J. - I agree.  
  
J.A.N. DE SILVA. J. - I agree.  
  
_Relief enhanced._**
