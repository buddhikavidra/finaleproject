**G. P. S. DE SILVA, C.J.**

** **

This is an application for maintenance. The parties are admittedly married.
The only point urged before us is that there is no application in terms of
section 13 of the Maintenance Ordinance inasmuch as there is only an affidavit
before the Court. However, in the affidavit dated 19.8.91 filed of record the
applicant has described herself as "the applicant". Moreover, the affidavit
sets out all facts which are material to her application for maintenance. We
hold that the affidavit alone constitutes sufficient compliance with section
13 of the Maintenance Ordinance.



The point raised before us is of a highly technical nature and is wholly
inappropriate in maintenance proceedings. In a maintenance



**13**



case the liability is of a civil nature, although the forum is the
Magistrate's Court. The Maintenance Ordinance was intended to provide a speedy
and an inexpensive mode for the enforcement of a civil liability, unfettered
by technical objections. The High Court Judge was correct in rejecting the
objection taken in terms of section 13 of the Ordinance.

We accordingly affirm the order of the High Court and dismiss the appeal. The
appellant must pay Rs. 750/- as costs of appeal to the applicant respondent.





**KULATUNGA, J. -** I agree.

**RAMANATHAN, J. -** I agree.



_Appeal dismissed._
