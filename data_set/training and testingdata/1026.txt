_

Costs - Order to prepay costs - Dismissal.

_

An order that the action would be dismissed if the plaintiff failed to pay
nominated costs before a fixed date and time if made without consent of the
parties does not entitle the Court to dismiss the action where such costs are
not paid as stipulated.

Case referred to

** _

Mamnoor v. Mohamed_ (1922) 23 NLR 493.

**

APPEAL** from the Court of Appeal.

Petitioner present in person.

Respondents are absent and unrepresented.

November 29, 1985. **  
COLIN-THOME, J.

**

The petitioner filed an application for damages in a sum of Rs. 1 lakh in D.
C. Kuliyapitiya, Case No. 6729/M. The case was fixed for trial on 18.07.84 and
according to journal entry No. 21, which was the first journal entry for that
date, it was recorded that the petitioner was absent and unrepresented. On
that basis the action was dismissed. Journal entry No. 22, the second entry
made on the same day states that she appears in court and files a motion and
moves that the case be called. Thereafter she has filed an affidavit and the
matter was fixed for inquiry.

After inquiry on 5.9.84 the learned District Judge made order permitting the
petitioner to continue with the case provided she paid a sum of Rs. 750 as
costs to the defendant on or before 5.11. 84 at or before 10.00 a.m. The Judge
made further order that if this payment

was not paid the earlier order dismissing the action was to stand. The case
was called on 6.11.84 and it was brought to the notice of the Court that the
costs ordered had not been paid by the petitioner. The petitioner was present
in court on that date and refused to pay any sum of money as costs and the
learned District Judge dismissed the action accordingly.

The plaintiff-appellant-petitioner appealed from this order to the Court of
Appeal by way of revision and the Court of Appeal refused notice and dismissed
her application.

A Full Bench of the Supreme Court held in Mamnoor v. Mohamed that "Apart from
consent of parties, the Court has no power to order when granting an
adjournment that if costs be not paid before the adjourned hearing, judgment
will be entered against the party failing to pay costs". Neither the District
Court nor the Court of Appeal has considered this judgment.

Having regard to the principle set out in Mamnoor v. Mohamed (supra) and in
regard to the circumstances in this case, we set aside the judgment of the
Court of Appeal and also the order of the District Judge dated 6.11.84 and
order the District Court of Kuliyapitiya to continue with the trial from where
it was adjourned on 16.01.84. There will be no costs.

RANASINGHE, J.** \- I agree.

TAMBIAH, J. **\- I agree. _  
  
Appeal allowed_.
