_     Landlord and tenant - Reasonable requirement - Sections 22(1) (bb) and
(1C) of the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 as amended by Law No. 10 of 1977 and Act
No. 55 of 1980 - Provision of alternative accommodation by the Commissioner of
National Housing._

**Held**

The certainty of providing alternative accommodation by the Commissioner of
National Housing to the tenant, is a factor that the court should take into
consideration in determining the reasonableness of a landlord's requirement.
This is not a decisive factor. The other relevant facts accepted by the
District Judge in this case, however militate against the reasonableness of
the landlord's requirement.

_Cur adv vult_

28th February, 1992.  
**DHEERARATNE, J.**

Plaintiff sued defendant his tenant to have him ejected from the rented
premises, the standard rent per month of which did not exceed Rs. 100, on the
ground that the premises **' were reasonably required for occupation as a
residence for the landlord' **in terms of section 22(1) (bb) of the Rent Act
No. 7 of 1972 as amended by Law No. 10 of 1977 and Act No. 55 of 1980. The
original court dismissed the plaintiff's action and that judgment was affirmed
by the Court of Appeal.

The only point of law taken up by the appellant before us, a point not covered
by authority so far, is whether the duty of the Commissioner of National
Housing to provide alternative accommodation to the tenant before he is
ejected, is a factor to be taken into consideration by a court in coming to a
decision under section 22(1) (bb) that the premises are reasonably required
for occupation as a residence for the landlord.

Section 22 (1C) reads; 'Where a decree for ejectment of the tenant of any
premises referred to in paragraph (bb) of subsection (1) is entered by any
court on the ground that such premises are reasonably required for occupation
as a residence for the landlord or any member of the family of such landlord,
no writ in execution of such decree shall be issued by such court until after
the Commissioner of National Housing has notified to such court that he

3

is able to provide alternate (sic) accommodation for such tenant. ('Alternate'
has been erroneously used for 'alternative' - see _Mawjood v. Pussadeniya_
(1).)

The view that in reaching a determination under section 8(C) of the Rent
Restriction Ordinance No. 60 of 1942 (a section comparable with section 22(1)
(bb) of the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 as amended) the requirement of premises for
landlord's use is reasonable, the surrounding relevant facts must be
considered and the lack of alternative accommodation for the tenant is one
such relevant fact, was taken in the cases of _Abeyewardene v. Nicolle_ (2)
and _Mohamed v Salahudeen_ (3) and as obiter dicta in _Raheem v. Jayawardene_
(4) and _Wijemanne & Co., Ltd. v. Fernando _(5). The contrary view was
expressed in _Fernando v. David_ (6) and _Atukorale v. Navaratnam_ (7) that
the requirement under section 8(c) shall be construed from the landlord's
point of view exclusively and all outside factors, including the tenant's
difficulties, are irrelevant and ought not to be taken into account. This
conflict was resolved by the decision in Gunasena v. Sangaralingam Pillai &
Co. (8), which favoured the former view and since then that view has been
consistently followed by courts. The foundation for that view appears to be
that 'reasonableness' is not one-sided.

If non-availability of alternative accommodation for the tenant is a relevant
factor in assessing the reasonableness of a landlord's requirement, so should
be the availability, of alternative accommodation for the tenant, as
reasonableness demands consideration by court of competing interests. However,
that is only one relevant factor and not a decisive factor. As observed by
Windham, J. in _Gunasena v. Sangaralingam Pillai_ ( _supra_ ) 'And so far as
concerns the question of alternative accommodation, I would guard against
saying that the court must satisfy itself (as it must under the English Acts)
that there is alternative accommodation for the tenant before eviction under
section 8(c). That is not the position. A case might well occur where, after
duly considering the facts of alternative accommodation the court might still
consider that the landlord's requirement was reasonable. This point was made
clear by _Soertsz, J. in Abeyewardene v. Nicolle_ ( _supra_ ). Alternative

4

accommodation is a relevant factor no more and no less, in determining whether
the requirement of the premises for the landlord's purposes is reasonable.

Had the plaintiff obtained judgment in his favour, the eviction of the tenant
could be effected only after the Commissioner of National Housing notifies
court that he is able to provide alternative accommodation. The date at which
the reasonable requirement of the landlord should be shown to exist is the
date when the court makes the ejectment order and not the date of the
institution of the action. See _lsmail v. Herft_ (9) ; _Andree v. de Fonseka_
(10); _Arnolis Appuhamy v. de Alwis_ (11) and Abdul Rahim v. Gunasena
Corporation Ltd(12)

Applying the principles emerging from the authorities referred to above, it
seems to me that learned counsel for the appellant is correct in his
submission that the certainty of providing alternative accommodation to the
tenant by the Commissioner of National Housing was a factor that the court
should have taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of the
landlord's requirement. But what do other relevant facts as accepted by the
learned judge reveal?

(1) The plaintiff's wife, daughter and son reside in a house gifted to the
daughter by his wife. No estrangement with the wife and children was alleged.

(2) The plaintiff resides in another house which is not a temporary residence
as he unsuccessfully attempted to picture in court.

(3) That the plaintiff had gifted to his son an upstair house consisting of
two units each bearing a separate assessment number. In respect of the upper
apartment, the plaintiff holds a decree of ejectment against its tenant,
entered by court of consent between the parties; the apartment on the ground
floor had been kept closed for a period of about two and a half years at the
time the plaintiff gave evidence.

These relevant facts militate against the reasonableness of the landlord's
requirement so much, that even if the certainty of providing

5

 alternative accommodation for the tenant by the Commissioner of National
Housing was taken into consideration, no court could possibly have with
justification arrived at a finding different from what was reached by the
original court.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed
with costs.

_Appeal dismissed._
