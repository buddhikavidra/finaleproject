##  Dhammika Chandratileke v. Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe - SLR - 303, Vol 2 of
1992 [1991] LKSC 12; (1992) 2 Sri LR 303 (4 June 1991)

**303**

**DHAMMIKA CHANDRATILEKE** **  
v.  
SUSANTHA MAHES MOONESINGHE**

SUPREME COURT  
BANDARANAYAKE, J.  
AMERASINGHE, J. AND  
DHEERARATNE, J.  
4TH JUNE AND 12TH DECEMBER, 1992.

_     Attorney-at-Law - Disciplinary Rule - Deceit and criminal breach of
trust - Judicature Act 42(2) read with the Supreme Court Rules 1978._

S. M. Moonesinghe an Attorney-at-Law carrying on business under the name and
style of T. M. Associates received a deposit of Rs. 50,000/- from Mrs.
Dhammika Chandratileke for which he issued a promissory note agreeing to pay
interest at 24% per annum. He paid interest upto July 1988 and thereafter
defaulted. After several requests and demands he issued Mrs. Chandratileke a
cheque for Rs. 20,000/- on 1.2.89 encashable on 15.6.89. But the cheque
bounced when it was presented as the account had been closed. Moonesinghe kept
on putting off Mrs. Chandratileke and eventually on a complaint made by her,
the Supreme Court issued a Rule under s.42(2) of the Judicature Act. The Rule
alleged that Moonesinghe had committed deceit and criminal breach of trust in
a sum of Rs. 50,000/-.

**Held:**

The respondent Moonesinghe should be removed of the office of attorney-at-taw
and his name struck off the roll.

**Held:** per Bandaranayake and Dheeraratne, JJ.

When formulating a Rule one has to bear in mind that s.42(2) of the Judicature
Act recites a species of conduct to wit: deceit, malpractice, crime or offence
which is viewed with disapproval by the Supreme Court. An Attorney-at-Law
guilty of such conduct is liable to be disciplined by the Court in terms of s.
42(2) and Rules made in terms of Article 136(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The language of section 42(2) of the Judicature Act cannot be divided into
parts, one variety of unconscionable conduct by an attorney-at-law permitting
the courts to exercise its jurisdiction, to wit; deceit or malpractice whereas
some other variety of unconscionable conduct, to wit; crime or offence
divesting the court of

304

its jurisdiction. It is essential the language of section 42(2) aforesaid be
viewed as a whole and a Rule formulated in such a manner as to give a
respondent sufficiently clear particulars as to the specific conduct that is
being examined by the Supreme Court as disciplinary action is not confined to
conduct or acts done in the course of an Attorney's professional practice.
Thus in the course of giving particulars in the instant case, a reference has
been made to the deception practised on the complainant by the respondent and
a specific reference made to the transaction concerning the acceptance of
money on trust on deposit to accrue interest and the breach of such trust
described in the Rule as criminal breach of trust. This description in the
Rule is legitimate and does in fact give the respondent a clear intimation of
what is in the mind of the disciplining authority. It is nothing more than
giving the respondent particulars of the matter to be examined by the Court.
The Rule as formulated is therefore without exception correct upon the facts.

**Per Bandaranayake, J.**

"The Supreme Court admits a person of good repute and of competent knowledge
and ability to the office of Attorney-at-Law,- likewise the Supreme Court may
admonish, reprimand, suspend or remove him from such office for guilty conduct
of the species enumerated in s. 42(2) aforesaid as the case may be . . ."

"The use of the word 'charge' in s.42(3) of the Judicature Act must be
understood in this way. The matters contained therein are descriptive of the
course of conduct of an Attorney to be examined. The provisions of section
42(3) and (4) are consistent with this view of section 42(2). The Supreme
Court here is exercising a disciplinary jurisdiction and not a penal
jurisdiction. It is the exercise of a special jurisdiction conferred on the
Supreme Court alone.

**_Per_ Amerasinghe, J. **

(1) "Conviction for an offence is neither necessary, nor invariably
sufficient, to make a person amenable to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this
Court. It is not an irrelevant matter, for conviction for an offence is a
prima facie, albeit only a prima facie, reason for this Court to act in
disciplinary proceedings. The question in proceedings of this nature, is not
whether an attorney-at-law has been, or may be convicted for or found guilty
of an offence or not, and if guilty whether he should be punished, but
whether, having regard to the misconduct established, he is a fit person to be
continued on the roll, and if so, on what terms."

(2) "An attorney whose misconduct is criminal in character. **Whether it was
done in pursuit of his profession or not** ... may be struck off the roll,
suspended

305

from practice, reprimanded, admonished or advised, even though he had not been
brought by the appropriate legal process before a court of competent
jurisdiction and convicted, and even though there is nothing to show that a
prosecution is pending or contemplated".

(3) If there has been a charge and conviction in full force and effect "the
attorney is debarred from traversing the conviction or from regarding the
findings of fact on which the conviction is based, but it would be open to him
to **confess and avoid** , that is to show by extra matter that in spite of
the conviction, he yet was not guilty of the crime or offence whereof he was
convicted, **whereby he would be liable under section 42 of the Judicature
Act. " **

(4) "This Court is the sole arbiter of the question whether or not a person is
fit to remain on the roll and, upon what conditions . . . In the determination
of that question, its powers are unfettered and untramelled by the findings of
fact, their interpretation, and the decisions of other judges and tribunals on
the basis of those facts."

(5) "Even if there is no conviction, yet if the attorney's conduct is
otherwise criminal in character, the Court would usually order the removal of
his name from the roll, if it was of a particularly reprehensible nature."

(6) "Although criminal misconduct prima facie makes a person unfit to be an
attorney-at-law, this, however, is not an inflexible rule."

(7) "A court acting in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction is concerned
with finding out whether the specifically, precisely and narrowly defined
ingredients of an offence have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, strictly
in accordance with the formal rules of evidence and procedure laid down for
that purpose, if it finds a person guilty, it pronounces a sentence of
punishment. The punishments it may impose are statutorily prescribed (see
Chapter III of the Penal Code), and may, in certain instances, include death,
rigorous or simple imprisonment, whipping, forfeiture of property or fine. Our
task, in the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction vested in us in terms
of section 42 of the Judicature Act, is the determination, based on an
appropriate degree of proof, having regard to the nature of the charge,
whether a person we formerly admitted should be struck off the roll,
suspended, reprimanded, admonished, or advised for his unprofessional conduct.
In the performance of that task, this court proceeds with its investigations
under section 42 of the Judicature Act, unfettered by invariable and
inflexible standards of proof or of rigid rules pertaining to procedure and
the admissibility of evidence.

306

(8) "I am inclined to think that the word "offence" in section 42(2) of the
Judicature Act has a wider meaning than that given to it in the Penal Code and
Code of Criminal Procedure. I think it means, disciplinary offence and
includes, conviction for an offence by a competent court, conduct that is
criminal in character, malpractice - whether the professional misconduct
involves moral turpitude or not - deceit, and all other forms of
unprofessional conduct in the sense of misconduct the Court ought to have
taken into account at the time of the admission of any attorney-at-law in
deciding whether he was a person of good repute."

5th June, 1991.  
**BANDARANAYAKE, J.**

Upon the complaint of Mrs. Dhammika Chandratileke of a fraud perpetrated
against her by Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe, Attorney-at-Law, the Court decided
to notice the Respondent Attorney. Copies of the affidavit of Mrs.
Chandratileke along with a notice calling for an explanation were despatched
through the usual channels to the Fiscal

309

for service and to the Respondent's known residences in view of the provisions
of s. 42(3) of the Judicature Act, These attempts failed.

Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act provides as follows:

"Every person admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law who shall be guilty
of any deceit, malpractice, crime or offence may be suspended from practice or
removed from office by any three judges of the Supreme Court sitting
together."

Numerous registered letters sent to the Respondent's known address were
returned undelivered except for one sent to his address in Panadura (which was
also the address of the Respondent according to a warrant of detention made
against the Respondent by the Magistrate's Court of Mount Lavinia in cases
56280 and 60932) and which was not returned. This is significant. The Fiscal
reported his inability to effect personal service as the Respondent could not
be found. According to a letter written by the Respondent dated 16.2.1990 to
A. L. M. Ameen, President's Counsel, who was a witness at the inquiry (the
letter being produced) the Respondent had left the country. That letter bears
no address of the sender. The court proceeded to frame a Rule against the
Respondent which it did on 24.12.90.

The Rule referred to the following amongst other matters:

"And whereas the said complaint bf the said Mrs. Dhammika Chandratileke and
other information available to this court discloses that you have committed -

(a) deceit; and

(b) criminal breach of trust of the (said) sum of Rs. 50,000/(falling within
the ambit of section 42(2) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978).

And where as this Court has decided that proceedings for suspension or removal
from the office of Attorney-at-Law should be taken against you under section
42(2) aforesaid read with the Supreme Court Rules 1978.

310

These are therefore to command you in terms of section 42(3) of the Judicature
Act of 1978 to appear before this court and show cause ... why you should not
be suspended or removed from office of Attorney-at-Law ...

The Respondent did not appear before the Court nor was he represented on the
date fixed for inquiry. Fiscal reported that summons could not be served on
the Respondent and the registered letters sent to the Respondent containing
the summons were returned undelivered. The Court postponed the inquiry for
21.2.91.

On 21.2.91 also the Respondent was absent and unrepresented. Summons were
returned undelivered. The case was postponed for 25.3.91. Mr. Daluwatte,
President's Counsel representing the Bar Association of Sri Lanka undertook to
provide the address given by the Respondent to the BASL. Registrar was
directed to reissue summons to that address which was done. On 25.3.91 again
the respondent was absent and unrepresented and summons returned undelivered.
At this stage Court directed substituted service by publication in the
newspapers. This was done. Inquiry was refixed for 4.6.91. Once again the
respondent was absent and unrepresented. But the Court decided to proceed with
the inquiry ex parte and the inquiry commenced. Whilst the inquiry was in
progress Registrar, Supreme Court, received a letter at 11.45 a.m. dated
2.6.91 purporting to be from a Law Firm in the Seychelles stating that they
were acting for the respondent and that they were instructed that the
respondent had got to know about the pending Rule against him before the
Supreme Court of Sri Lanka from the newspapers and prayed that the respondent
be granted a further date so that arrangements could be made for the
respondent to be represented at the inquiry. Despite the uncertainty of the
genuineness of this communication the Court postponed the inquiry for 12.11.91
and the writer from Seychelles, to wit: Director, Francis Rachel Law Centre,
Francis Rachel Street, Victoria, Seychelles was so informed. On 12.11.91 as
the respondent was again absent and unrepresented inquiry proceedings of
4.6.91 were adopted by the Court with the consent of all Counsel present and
further evidence of Hatton National Bank officers were taken and the inquiry
concluded. No further communication has been received from the Seychelles Law
Centre.

311

The evidence recorded on 4.6.91 was as follows: Mrs. Dhammika Chandratileke,
Assistant Registrar, University of Colombo, who was the complainant, stated
that on the recommendations of Mr. Mahathanthila, Registrar of the University
at that time, the complainant invested Rs. 50,000/- with the respondent, S. M.
Moonesinghe, carrying on business under the name and style of "T. M.
Associates". That was on 27.7.87. In consideration of that she was issued
Promissory Note P2 for the repayment of the capital and interest at 24% per
annum but with a deduction of Rs. 2000% being 1st month's interest, amounting
to a sum of Rs. 72,000/-. She had earlier visited T. M. Associates on 19.1.87
and met the Respondent Mahes Moonesinghe and having spoken to him and on his
promise to pay 24% interest on a deposit which worked out to Rs. 2000/- per
month, she handed over the capital sum of Rs. 50,000/- to him. The respondent
issued to her promissory note P2 which was signed by him in her presence. The
document P2 contains an undertaking that - quote - "I, the undersigned
Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe ... promise to pay Mrs. Dhammika Chandratileke . .
. the sum of Seventy Two Thousand currency for value received with interest
thereon at the rate of 24% per centum per annum, from date hereof." It was
Mrs. Chandratileke's evidence that the first month's interest amounting to Rs.
2000/- was deducted and the note given for Rs. 72,000/-. She also stated that
she has received interest in October 1987, did not receive interest for
November 1987 and received interest from December 1987 to July 1988 totalling
Rs. 18000/-. She had to go to the respondent's office to collect these sums of
monthly interest and sign a registrar maintained by him. A yellow card issued
to her she had lost. The July 1988 interest was given later. Thereafter in
August 1988 the Respondent informed her that he was financially bankrupt and
that the auditor was checking his balance account. Thereafter Respondent sent
letter P3 informing her that his office was shifting to Duplication Road.
Witness identified the signature of the Respondent in P3. Thereafter witness
visited the office at Duplication Road (R. A. de Mel Mawatha) more than 20
times. She met the respondent two or three times and asked for the return of
the capital sum invested. Respondent replied that he did not have money to
settle her and gave her a post-dated cheque P4. This cheque was issued on the
Hatton National Bank and dated 15.6.89 the payee being Mrs. Chandratileke for
the amount of Rs. 20,000/-. When issuing the

312

cheque the respondent made an endorsement on P2 to the effect that witness
received Rs. 20,000/- as return of part capital by cheque No. 293718 dated
15.6.89 drawn on Hatton National Bank. Witness signed endorsement and
identified same. The cheque had been signed, witness says, by M. Moonesinghe
and the cheque Number was 293718. This cheque was issued to her by the
respondent on 1.2.89. Witness said she kept the cheque with her until the
first week of July 1989 because she did not have a current account in a Bank.
She handed it to Mr. Mahatantila to be presented for claim through his bank
account (the People's Bank, Union Place Branch, Colombo) which he had done on
13.7.89. She endorsed the cheque when she gave it to Mahatantila. Later
Mahatantila returned the cheque to her as it had been returned to him with an
endorsement "Account closed on 13.3.1989" in red ink.

Witness thereupon complained to the Police. Witness handed over the original
cheque to OIC Kollupitiya on 12.8.89. She also complained to the CID Fraud
Bureau. A certified copy of her complaint to the Police was produced P5.
Witness said that to date she has not received Rs. 20,000/- or other part of
the capital sum invested from the respondent. The witness was tendered for
cross-examination by Mr. N. R. M. Daluwatte, President's Counsel representing
the Bar Association of Sri Lanka. Her evidence was not challenged.

Witness Mahatantila confirmed that he advised Mrs. Chandratileke to invest
money with T. M. Associates. He also confirmed that Mrs. Chandratileke gave
his cheque P4 for encashment through his Bank account which he did after
15.6.89 and that it was returned by the Bank with a note reading "account
closed" on 13.3.89 in red ink. Witness returned the cheque P4 to Mrs.
Chandratileke.

Witness M. L. M. Ameen, President's Counsel produced a photocopy of a letter
dated 16.6.90 written to him by Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe, Attorney-at-Law
and Notary Public marked P1. The original of P1 had been produced in a case in
Magistrate's Court, Mount Lavinia. In the letter P1 the writer has stated that
he had considerable difficulty in appearing before the Magistrate's Court as
the CID who were investigating into a complaint had been following

313

him on such occasions. Mr. Ameen also said that he received a telephone call
from Mahes Moonesinghe from Singapore after he received P1 (16.2.90) and that
he informed Moonesinghe that a Rule had been issued against him by the Supreme
Court and that the matter was called before the Court and that as he was not
present it was put off. Moonesinghe had replied that he had heard about the
Rule. Moonesinghe did not indicate when he would come to Sri Lanka. Mr. Ameen
had appeared for Moonesinghe in the Magistrate's Court but was not
representing him in the matter of the Rule.

Witness J. A. D. R. Jayasinghe, Acting Registrar, Magistrate's Court, Mount
Lavinia, produced the original of the letter P1 (marked also as P1). The
letter is dated 16.2.90 and has been written to Mr. M. L. M. Ameen, Attorney-
at-Law on the letter-head paper of Susantha Moonesinghe, Solicitor and Notary
Public. No address is given of the sender. Mr. Ameen identified the signature
of Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe. It states that the writer had to leave the
Country and remain out until such time as matters are sorted out. The letter
refers to two cases filed against the writer to wit: M.C. Mount Lavinia Cases
Nos. 56280 and 60932 and requests Mr. Ameen to continue to appear in those
cases on his behalf in his absence. This witness was submitted for cross-
examination but no questions were asked of him.

Next, evidence regarding the Bank account of the respondent at the Hatton
National Bank was led. S. M. Moonesinghe had opened Account No. 330788 with
the Hatton National Bank, City Office on 31.1.89 with a cash deposit of
Rs..20,000/-. Thereafter the respondent had made deposits to the credit of
this account and made withdrawals. Witness produced statement of account P6.
Cheque P4 bearing No. 293.78 refers to account No. 330788 aforesaid. The
statement shows that the account had been opened on 31.1.89 and closed on
13.3.89. Sums of money had been frequently deposited and frequently withdrawn
from this account in the short period of its existence. On 13.3.89 the credit
balance was Rs. 24.25. One sees the unsatisfactory state of this account. For
example, on 3.3.89 the credit balance was only Rs. 339.25. Then there has
been. a deposit of money amounting to Rs. 15000/- by 7th March and again a
balance of only Rs. 24.50 by 13.3.89. This shows a pattern of deposits and
quick withdrawals. When the respondent

314

issued P4 the post-dated cheque dated 15.2.89 for Rs. 20,000/- on 1.2.89 the
respondent had opened this account only the previous day (31.1.89) with a cash
deposit of Rs. 20,000/-. Then on 15.2.89 the respondent had deposited Rs.
30000/- by 5 cash deposits and on the same day withdrawn Rs. 25,000/- by cash
cheque leaving a balance of only Rs. 5,694.25 to meet the cheque P4 for Rs.
20,000%. Undated letter (a copy of which was produced as P7) was sent by the
Senior Manager of the Bank, J. M. J. Perera informing the respondent of the
closure of his account No. 330788 for unsatisfactory conduct. This letter
states . . . "We regret to note that within the short period (since 31.1.89)
we have returned 4 cheques drawn by you for lack of funds . . . We expect you
to maintain a minimum balance of Rs. 20,000/-. . . we hereby give you notice
to close your account by 3rd March 1989 . . . " Cross-examination by Mr.
Daluwatte, President's Counsel, was directed at elucidating a few matters
arising upon the evidence.

The evidence regarding the cheque P4 was as follows: Romali Abeysekera, Staff
Officer, Hatton National Bank, City Office, stated that P4 came to her through
the clearing department. P4 related to account No. 330788 of S. M.
Moonesinghe. She made an endorsement on the cheque stating that the account
had been closed on 13.3.89 and returned the cheque. This witness also stated
that she had come across abut 20 cheques stated as drawn by S. M. Moonesinghe
after the account was closed. That was both before and after discovering P4.
Witness also identified letter P7 the letter sent by the Manager by registered
post to S. M. Moonesinghe informing him that his account was closed for
unsatisfactory conduct. P7A the registered postal article receipt dated
13.3.89 was produced. P7B a document maintained by the Bank showed letter 8002
had been sent to S. M. Moonesinghe to the address given in his application P8.
I am satisfied that the respondent was duly informed in February that he
should close his account by 3rd March. Witness Gunatillake, Staff Assistant of
the Hatton National Bank produced a certified copy of the application made by
S. M. Moonesinghe to open the account marked P8. In that application the
applicant has styled himself as a businessman. Witness also produced as P9 the
specimen signature of S. M. Moonesinghe retained by the Bank. This witness
confirmed through entries made by the Bank Manager in

315

P10, a record card containing entries "CNR" which means covers not received
(i.e.) insufficient funds, that several cheques issued by S. M. Moonesinghe
were returned for lack of funds. This witness was familiar with the signature
of the manager.

The above constituted the evidence led by the Deputy Solicitor-General against
the respondent. This is the only evidence placed before this Court. The
testimony of the complainant has been amply supported by the documentary
evidence to wit: the Promissory Note P2, cheque P4 and supported by the
evidence of witness Mahatantila. The Court unhesitatingly accepts their
testimony as truthful and reliable. The fact that the respondent accepted the
investment of Rs. 50,000/- from the witness Chandratileke on 27.10.87 is
proved beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent agreed to pay interest of 24%
per annum at that time in monthly instalments. The respondent has paid monthly
instalments of interest up to and including July 1988. Thereafter he has paid
nothing and in fact stated that he was bankrupt. Upon the complainant
demanding some payment the respondent has given her a post-dated cheque for
Rs. 20,000/- on 1.2.89 encashable on 15.6.89. But the Bank statement P6 shows
that the respondent had only a balance of Rs. 24.25 on 13.3.89. When the Bank
account was closed.

Respondent opened the account on 31.1.89 with a deposit of Rs. 20,000/-. He
wrote P4 for Rs. 20,000/- the next day on 1.2.89. From 31.1.89 to 13.3.89 - a
period of 6 weeks - the respondent has made transactions through this account
either of deposits, purported , deposits or withdrawals on 31.1.89, 2.2.89,
6.2.89, 7.2.89, 9.2.89, 10.2.89, 13.2.89, 14.2.89, 15.2.89, 21.2.89, (4
entries), 23.2.89 (6 entries), 24.2.89, 28.2.89, 3.3.89, 7.3.89 (6 entries)
and 10.3.89. By P7 he had been informed by the Bank that he should close his
account by 3rd March. I am satisfied that by 7.3.89 the respondent knew the
parlous state of his account and that he had no funds in this account to meet
P4. Thus, knowing that P4 will be dishonoured the respondent has taken no step
to inform the complainant of the fact that he had no funds to meet P4 or to
make other arrangements regarding payment of dues to the complainant.

The Rule specifies that the complaint and other information available to the
court discloses that the Respondent has committed

316

(a) deceit; and

(b) committed breach of trust of a sum of of Rs. 50,000/-;

which was money deposited with the Respondent by the complainant as savings to
accrue interest. It requires the Respondent to show cause as to why he should
not be suspended or removed from the office of Attorney-at-Law;

When formulating a Rule one has to bear in mind that s.42(2) of the Judicature
Act recites a species of conduct, to wit: deceit, malpractice, crime or
offence which is viewed with disapproval by the Supreme Court. An Attorney-at-
Law guilty of such conduct is liable to be disciplined by the Court in terms
of s.42(2) and Rules made in terms of Article 136(1) (g) of the Constitution.

The language of section 42(2) of the Judicature Act cannot be divided into
parts, one variety of unconscionable conduct by an Attorney-at-Law permitting
the court to exercise its jurisdiction, to wit: deceit or malpractice, whereas
some other variety of unconscionable conduct, to wit: crime or offence
divesting the court of its jurisdiction. It is essential that the language of
section 42(2) aforesaid be viewed as a whole and a Rule formulated in such a
manner as to give a Respondent sufficiently clear particulars as to the
specific conduct that is being examined by the Supreme Court as disciplinary
action is not confined to conduct or acts done in the course of an Attorney's
professional practice. Thus in the course of giving particulars in the instant
case, a reference has been made to the deception practised on the complainant
by the Respondent and a specific reference made to the transaction concerning
the acceptance of money on trust on deposit to accrue interest and the breach
of such trust described in the Rule as criminal breach of trust. This
description in the Rule is to my mind legitimate and does in fact give the
Respondent a clear intimation of what is in the mind of the disciplinary
authority. It is nothing more than giving the Respondent particulars of the
matter to be examined by the Court. The Rule as formulated is therefore
without exception correct upon the facts. I am therefore unable to agree with
the view expressed by my brother Amerasinghe, J. in this regard.

317

The Supreme Court admits a person of good repute and of competent knowledge
and ability to the office of Attorney-at-Law; likewise the Supreme Court may
admonish, reprimand, suspend or remove him from such office for guilty conduct
of the species enumerated in s.42(2) aforesaid as the case may be. In any
event no matter of law arising from the Rule Nisi was raised or argued by any
Counsel appearing at the inquiry.

The use of the word 'charge' in s.42(3) of the Judicature Act must be
understood in this way. The matters contained therein are descriptive of the
course of conduct of an Attorney to be examined. The provisions of section
42(3) and (4) are consistent with this view of section 42(2). The Supreme
Court here is exercising a disciplinary jurisdiction and not a penal
jurisdiction. It is the exercise of a special jurisdiction conferred on the
Supreme Court alone.

Upon the facts it is abundantly clear that the Respondent deceived the
complainant into the belief that P4 will be honoured and she will recover part
of her monies due to her. Also the Respondent has been in breach of the trust
reposed in him when the complainant deposited money with him in order that
interest may accrue on the deposit. The Respondent has failed to pay interest
or repay the capital sum invested. The Respondent has not denied the
allegations or offered any explanation whatsoever in his defence. The
Respondent is guilty of both charges laid in the Rule. The Respondent
therefore is guilty of gross misconduct. ,

Upon the foregoing proved facts in my view the Respondent is unfit to function
as an Attorney-at-Law of this court. I am of opinion that the Rule should be
made absolute. I direct that the Respondent Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe be
removed from the office of an Attorney-at-Law of this court and that his name
be struck off the Roll of Attorney-at-Law.

Registrar to take steps accordingly.

**DHEERARATNE, J.** \- I agree.

318

**AMERASINGHE, J.**

I have had the advantage of reading a draft of the judgment of Bandaranayake,
J. I respectfully agree with His Lordship that Moonesinghe should be removed
from office. Moonesinghe was charged in the Rule with (1) deceit and (2)
criminal breach of trust. As for the charge of deceit, I agree that
Moonesinghe is guilty of deceit. As for criminal breach of trust, I agree that
Moonesinghe is guilty, but, perhaps we reach that conclusion somewhat
differently.

In a technical sense, criminal breach of trust is a specifically defined
offence in section 388 of the Penal Code. There was no evidence that
Moonesinghe was convicted by a competent court. I do not hold him "not guilty"
or "guilty" of the offence of criminal breach of trust as defined in the Penal
Code; for that is matter to be determined by a competent court designated by
the Code of Criminal Procedure for that purpose in other proceedings, if it is
decided that he should be prosecuted.

Conviction for an offence is neither necessary, nor invariably sufficient, to
make a person amenable to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court. It is
not an irrelevant matter, for conviction for an offence is a prima facie,
albeit only a prima facie, reason for this Court to act in disciplinary
proceedings. The Court has a wide jurisdiction in deciding what is
unprofessional conduct that makes a person amenable to disciplinary
proceedings. The question in proceedings of this nature, is not whether an
attorney-at-law has been, or may be convicted for or found guilty of an
offence or not, and if guilty whether he should be punished, but whether,
having regard to the misconduct established, he is a fit person to be
continued on the roll, and if so, on what terms. It may well be that the facts
establishing unprofessional conduct may also be the foundation of a criminal
prosecution, past, present or to come. However, it is unnecessary to decide,
and I wish to make it clear that I have not decided, that the facts proved
satisfy the criteria set out in section 388 of the Penal Code, for the
ascertainment of whether Moonesinghe is guilty of the penal offence of
criminal breach of trust is not the object and intention of these proceedings.
Having regard to the object and intention of these proceedings, I find that a
non-technical, popular, meaning - uti

319

loquitur vulgus - rather than the technical meaning usually given to the
phrase by lawyers, is more appropriate and agreeable in deciding what criminal
breach of trust means in the Rule. I find Moonesinghe guilty of criminal
breach of trust in that non-technical, popular sense. However, having regard
to the ambiguous nature of the phrase, and the horrendous consequences of
being, albeit mistakenly, supposed that he has been convicted of the penal
offence criminal breach of trust, I want it to be clearly understood in what
sense I find him guilty of criminal breach of trust. Criminal breach of trust
is a phrase which should not be allowed to needlessly escalate into a
sentence. For what he has done, he does not, more or less, owe the law his
life. (Timon).

On 27 July 1987, Mrs. Dhammika Chandratileke, an Assistant Registrar at the
University of Colombo, on the recommendations of Mr. Mahathanthila, the
Registrar of the University of Colombo, invested a sum of Rs. 50,000/- with
Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe who was carrying on the business of borrowing and
lending money under the name and style of an organization known "T M.
Associates (Pvt) Ltd". In return, Moonesinghe, issued a Promissory Note (P2)
dated 27 October 1987. In terms of the Promissory note Moonesinghe personally
undertook to pay Mrs. Chandratileke on demand or order the sum of Rs. 72,000.
In terms of a contract arrived at discussions held between Moonesinghe and
Mrs. Chandratileke, she was to be repaid the capital and interest at the rate
of 24 per centum per annum, less the first month's instalment, in monthly
instalments of Rs. 2000. Nine monthly payments were made between October 1987
and July 1988\. The instalment for November 1987 was not paid.

In his letter dated 28 August 1988, Moonesinghe informed Mrs. Chandratileke
that "due to unforeseen commitments", the "Company", was "reluctantly
compelled to suspend payments for the next three months commencing 01st
September 1988." Payments were to be thereafter "revised and reviewed from
time to time." The letter, he explained, "was an appeal for understanding,
support and forbearing" and Mrs. Chandratileke was told "not to hesitate to
write or meet" Moonesinghe if she wished to discuss "any personal matter or to
know further details."

320

This was easier said than done: After over twenty visits to his office, and
after meeting him on several occasions to obtain a return of her money, on 1
February 1989 Mrs. Chandratileke succeeded in obtaining a cheque (P4) for Rs.
20,000 from Moonesinghe. Moonesinghe wrote the following endorsement on the
Promissory Note (P2): "Received Rs. 20,000/- as part capital by chq. No.
293718 (HNB) dated 15-6-89. Balance due to me on this Pro-note is 20,725/-".
Mrs. Chandratileke signed it. The cheque given to Mrs. Chandratileke on 1
February, 1989 was dated 15 June 1989. It was signed by Moonesinghe, and drawn
on the Hatton National Bank. When the cheque was presented, it was returned
dishonoured, bearing the endorsement "Account closed on 13.3.1989". Mrs.
Chandratileke then complained to the Police on 12 August 1991. (P5).

She also complained to the Chief Justice. In her letter dated 8 September
1989, Mrs. Chandratileke prayed that his Lordship "be pleased to direct an
inquiry to be held to ascertain whether Mr. Mahes Moonesinghe is a fit and
proper person to hold the office of an Attorney-at-Law". On 30 November 1989,
Mrs. Chandratileke, set out her complaint in the form of an affidavit. A copy
of the affidavit with a letter calling for his observations were sent to
Moonesinghe by Registered post to three addresses: at Malabe, Rajagiriya and
Panadura. The documents sent to Malabe and Rajagiriya were returned
undelivered. When there was no response from Moonesinghe, a copy of the
affidavit and Registrar's letter were sent to the Panadura address where the
earlier documents had been delivered. This time they were returned
undelivered.

A Rule nisi was issued 'by this Court on 24.12.1990 requiring Moonesinghe to
appear before this Court on 21 January 1991 and show cause why in terms of
section 42(2) of the Judicature Act, he should not be suspended or removed.
Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 provides that before any
attorney-at-law is suspended or removed, "a notice containing a copy of the
charge or charges against him and calling upon him to show cause within a
reasonable time why he should not be suspended or removed, as the case may be,
shall be personally served on him. If, however, personal service cannot be
effected, the Supreme Court shall order such substituted service as it may
deem fit." The fiscal reported his

321

inability to serve summons personally on Moonesinghe. Notices sent by
registered post were returned undelivered. By order of Court, substituted
service was published in the newspapers. There was no response from
Moonesinghe.

On 4 June 1991, the Court commenced its inquiry in the matter of the Rule.
According to the evidence of Mr. M. L. M. Ameen, P.C., at that inquiry, he had
been retained by Moonesinghe to appear for him in the Magistrate's Court of
Mount Lavinia. He produced a copy of a letter (P1) dated 16 February 1990 from
Moonesinghe. In that letter, Moonesinghe explained why he was an elusive
Fugitive: He said that when he appeared in Court, his creditors attempted to
"waylay" him; and once he had to leave the court-house "from the rear side".
Since he did not think it was "safe any more... to appear in public", he "had
to leave the country and remain out until such time these matters are sorted
out." According to Mr. Ameen, P.C., Moonesinghe telephoned him from Singapore
and told him that he was aware of the issue of the Rule. During the inquiry
held by the Supreme Court on 4 June 1991, a letter, dated 2 June 1991
addressed to the Registrar of the Supreme Court purporting to be from the
Director of the Francis Rachel Law Centre, Attorney-at-Law and Notaries Public
of the Seychelles, was placed before the Court. The Director stated that it
had been gathered by their "client" Susantha M. Moonesinghe, after reading
about it in the newspapers, that an inquiry was pending against him in the
Supreme Court. The Centre, which was acting for and on behalf of Moonesinghe,
prayed that an adjournment of the proceedings be granted to enable Moonesinghe
to be represented at the inquiry. The Court adjourned the inquiry and fixed
further hearing for 12 November 1991 and so informed the Director of the
Francis Rachel Law Centre by Registered Post. In a letter dated 6 September
1991, the Director-General of the Postal Services Divisions of the Seychelles
stated that that Law Firm no longer existed. When the matter came on for
inquiry of 12 November 1991, Moonesinghe was absent and unrepresented. With
the consent of the counsel for the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Deputy
Solicitors-General who were present, the evidence already recorded was adopted
and further evidence was recorded.

In _Bhandari v. Advocates Committee_ (1) (followed with approval in _Re
Dematagodage Don Harry Wilbert_ (2) it was said that "in every allegation of
professional misconduct involving an element of deceit

322

or moral turpitude a high standard of proof is called for, and we cannot
envisage any body of professional men sitting in judgment on a colleague who
would be content to condemn him on a mere balance of probabilities."

The Rule nisi charges Moonesinghe with (1) deceit and (2) criminal breach of
trust. Both deceit and criminal breach of trust involve dishonesty. Section 22
of the Penal Code (Cap. 25) states that "Whoever does anything with the
intention of causing wrongful gain to -one person or wrongful loss to another
person is said to do that thing "dishonestly". Where knowledge or intention is
an ingredient of a disciplinary offence, it is the view in the United Kingdom
that it seems appropriate that the criminal standard of proof should apply.
(See Cordery's Law Relating to Solicitors, 1961, 5th Ed. at p.467.Cf. Re Two
Solicitors, ex parte Incorporated _Law Society_ (3); _Hall v. Jordan_ (4);
_Younghusband v. Luftig_ (5); _Wilson v Inyang_ (6). Although in Re Wilbert
(supra) at p.29 Fernando, J. states that "a degree of proof commensurate with
the subject-matter is necessary", and although in deciding a matter involving
dishonesty, his Lordship was satisfied "beyond all reasonable doubt" that the
attorney was guilty (see at p. 28), however, at p.28 his Lordship states that
"In proceedings of this nature, it is not necessary that the acts alleged be
proved beyond reasonable doubt."

In this case I cannot have any real doubt as to the facts. They have been
established beyond reasonable doubt. I think Moonesinghe intentionally
deceived Mrs. Chandratileke into an erroneous belief that he meant to repay
the sum of Rs. 50;000% she had given him with interest and thereby induced her
to give him the said sum of money when he had no intention of repaying the
money in the manner agreed upon. What Moonesinghe really had in mind was
wrongful personal gain, and he dishonestly induced Mrs. Chandratileke to give
him the said sum of Rs. 50,000/-. He then dishonestly misappropriated or
converted to his own use the sum of Rs. 50,000/given to him by Mrs.
Chandratileke in violation of his undertaking and his legal obligation to
repay the money so entrusted to him. I have no doubt that when Moonesinghe
issued the Cheque for Rs. 20,000 on 1 February, 1989 (P4), it was a sham. It
was a piece of trickery. He

323

deceived Mrs. Chandratileke. He persuaded her to show him the "understanding,
support, and forbearance" he had prayed for in his letter of 28 August 1989
and accept a post-dated cheque by misleading her to confidently believe that a
sum of Rs. 20,000 would be paid to her on or after 15 June 1989 and that the
balance sum of Rs. 20,725/- would be paid sometime thereafter. The cheque was
drawn on an account Moonesinghe had opened a day before. He had made a cash
deposit of Rs. 20,000 when he opened his account. This was not with the
intention of having sufficient funds to honour his cheque, but to meet the
requirement of the Bank that he should make a minimum deposit of Rs. 20,000%.
It was a minimum sum he never maintained to honour either his obligations to
the Bank or to Mrs. Chandratileke. Deducting the cost of the cheque book
issued to him, viz., Rs. 105, he had insufficient funds to meet the value of
the cheque even when he issued it. In any event, had he Rs. 20,000 in his
account on that date, it was of little use to Mrs. Chandratileke, since her
cheque was dated 15 June 1989. By that date, the account had been closed.
Moonesinghe, of course, could not have known that the cheque would not be
honoured because his account would be closed by June 15. Indeed, he might have
optimistically hoped that it would go on for as long as possible to enable him
to carry out more of his sinister designs. He did not voluntarily close his
account. The Bank ordered him, by a letter sent by Express Registered Post
(P7), to close his account by 3 March 1989 and proceeded to close it on 13
March 1989, because Moonesinghe had with reckless disregard been issuing
cheques without sufficient funds in his account to meet his obligations and
failed to keep the minimum credit balance of Rs. 20,000/- required of him as
an account holder. All of this is manifestly clear from Moonesinghe's
Statement of Account (P6) and the evidence of the Bank's officers. Several
cheques had been returned for lack of sufficient funds before the account was
closed. Romali Abeysekera, a Staff Officer of the Bank stated in her evidence
that about twenty cheques drawn by Moonesinghe were presented after the
account had been closed. Having regard to the way in which he operated his
account, I have no doubt in my mind that Moonesinghe knew that the cheque he
gave Mrs. Chandratileke was a worthless piece of paper and that it would not
be honoured at any time. If his intentions were honourable, why did he fail to
inform Mrs. Chandratileke of the fact

324

that his account was closed and allow her to hopefully retain the cheque and
present it for payment several months after his account was closed?

I am of the view that the charge of deceit has been amply proved. Moonesinghe
is guilty of deceit that was grave and reprehensible. It would, as was said by
Lord Justice Lindley in re Weare (7) "I be a "stretch of charity which would
degenerate into absurd and ridiculous weakness" to allow myself to express any
doubts on these matters. It would, as Lindley, LJ said, be "idle and childish
to come to any other conclusion"

The Rule also charges Moonesinghe with "criminal breach of trust". Criminal
breach of trust may be either a penal offence, conviction for which would be a
prima facie reason why the Supreme Court should act in the exercise of its
disciplinary powers in terms of Section 42 of the Judicature Act; or the
phrase may be taken to be a convenient, shorthand way of describing, in a non-
technical way, deceitful conduct involving a breach of confidence which is
grave in character, making an attorney-at-Law who is guilty of such
unprofessional conduct amenable to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in terms of section 42 of the Judicature Act. I shall deal with
these matters separately.

What "Criminal breach of trust" usually, in an everyday sense, means to us, as
lawyers, and, therefore, technically, is an offence defined in the terms set
out in section 388 of the Penal Code. Since this is primarily a matter for
decision by lawyers about the alleged misconduct of a lawyer, I shall first
deal with the question from a lawyer's point of view.

Section 389 of the Penal Code provides for the punishment of a person guilty
of the offence of Criminal breach of trust as defined in the Penal Code.

Being a "thing made punishable by" the Penal Code, criminal breach of trust
is, in terms of section 38 of the Penal Code and section 2 (s.v. "offence") of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, an "offence".

325

In terms of Article 13 (3) of the Constitution, "Any person charged with an
offence shall be entitled to be heard in person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a
fair trial by a competent court." And Article 13(5) of the Constitution
provides that "Every person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved
guilty." A court having jurisdiction in terms of section 10 and the First
Schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a competent court to hear, try
and determine whether the offence of criminal breach of trust had been
committed.

No evidence was placed before this Court, as it was done, for instance, in _Re
Ranasinghe_ (8); The _Solicitor-General v. Chelvatamby_ (9); _Solicitor-
General v. Cooke_ (10); in _Re Aiyadurai_ (11); in _Solicitor-General v. Abdul
Cader_ (12) and in _Re Fernando_ (13), showing that Moonesinghe had been
convicted for the offence of criminal breach of trust by a competent court
having jurisdiction in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

What may the Court do when, as in this case, an attorney-at-law charged in a
Rule with misconduct that appears to be a criminal offence, has not been
convicted for that offence?

Where the amenability of an attorney-at-law to the disciplinary jurisdiction
of this Court is supposed to depend (because the Rule is so framed in
restricted terms) on the question whether he is guilty of an offence as
defined in the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, and guilt is denied,
the Court, may, perhaps, postpone the hearing of the disciplinary inquiry
until the attorney concerned had been heard and tried by a court of competent
jurisdiction as defined by the Code of Criminal Procedure. This, I think, is
as far as _Shore v. Pratt_ (14); In the matter of _Knight and Hall_ (15); _Re
Hill_ (16) _per Cockburn, J and per Blackburn, J at pp. 545, 548; Re a
Solicitor_ (17)" should be permitted to take us.

There is no denial in the case before us. Nor is the Rule restrictively framed
in this matter. There was no occasion for the Court to consider whether in the
exercise of its discretion, these proceedings might be postponed.

Even where the amenability of an attorney to the disciplinary jurisdiction of
this Court does not depend on conviction for an

326

offence, it may in the exercise of its discretion, where its findings on the
same facts might prejudice the attorney, postpone the disciplinary
proceedings. In _Re P. P. Wickremasinghe_ (18) a Rule was issued on 18 June
1981 on an attorney-at-law, charging him with deceit and malpractice by
appropriating the money of his client to his own use. On 16 October 1981,
counsel, on behalf of the attorney, informed the Supreme Court that there was
a criminal charge in respect of the same matter in the High Court of Colombo
and requested that the inquiry pertaining to' the Rule be postponed on account
of possible prejudice. Samarakoon, CJ (Weereratne and Sharvananda, JJ
agreeing) ordered (SC Minutes of 16 October 1981) that "the inquiry be
postponed and fixed on a date subsequent to the final determination of the
High Court case." The Court, not being subject to statutory constraints of
time in these matters, may await the decision of the criminal court, if in its
opinion, in the circumstances of a particular case, it considers that to be
the desirable course of action. The attorney, in the meantime, in the exercise
of the powers of the Court in terms of the proviso to section 42 (3) of the
Judicature Act, may, as he was in Wickremasinghe's case, be suspended from
practice. (For the later proceedings in the case see SC Minutes of 19 July
1982 per Wimalaratne, Victor Perera and Soza, JJ).

Alternatively, instead of postponing the proceedings, it may refrain from
making a decision touching a matter pending before a criminal court, and
proceed to deal with the attorney on the basis of the other matters alleged in
the Rule. Thus in Dematagodage Don Harry Wilbert (2), where the attorney was
charged in the Rule with having fraudulently used as genuine a certificate
which he knew or had reason to believe to be a forged document, and of deceit,
Fernando, J at p.29 (Atukorale and Bandaranayake, JJ agreeing) said as
follows:

It transpired that criminal proceedings are contemplated against the
Respondent for forgery; although not obliged to do so, in view of our order in
this matter, we refrain from making any finding in respect of the charge of
fraudulently or dishonestly using as genuine a certificate known to be forged.

The attorney was found guilty of deceit and struck off. The phrase, "although
not obliged to do so", does not, in my view, mean that there

327

was the recognition of a right to convict and punish the attorney of an
offence under section 459 of the Penal Code for using as genuine a forged
document, as if the Court had parallel jurisdiction with a Court empowered by
the Code of Criminal Procedure to determine such a matter: Fernando, J. had
earlier at p.28 made it manifestly clear that the proceedings before him were
"not criminal or penal in nature". And at p.30 his Lordship stated that "The
jurisdiction under section 42(2) does not involve considerations of punishment
or penalty or stigma". I think his Lordship meant that this Court is not
precluded, on the facts established, of finding an attorney guilty, not of a
specific penal offence as if it had a parallel jurisdiction, but of
unprofessional conduct that would make a person unfit to continue on the roll,
although such a finding might be based on the same facts upon which an
attorney had already been convicted; or upon which a pending or contemplated,
or possible, prosecution might be founded. With such a view, I would
respectfully agree.

The fact that there has been no conviction, or that a prosecution is pending,
or that no prosecution is contemplated, does not preclude this Court from
holding an inquiry, in the exercise of its disciplinary jurisdiction, with a
view to ascertaining whether an attorney was guilty of misconduct, criminal or
otherwise, that makes him unfit to be a member of the legal profession. In
fact, the several interests of the State, the Courts and the administration of
justice, suitors, the public and the profession, require that the matters of
this sort should be determined by this Court without delay, where it is
feasible to do so on the available evidence. It was realized over a century
ago that this Court should not unduly delay the disposal of these matters. In
_Re Edgar Edema_ (19), Phear, CJ. observed as follows:

We took time to consider our judgment not so much on account of any doubt upon
the facts in issue between the parties, as for the purpose of endeavouring to
find some ground upon which we could offer the respondent a locus poenitentiae
and a hope, however slight, of being allowed upon condition at some future
time to apply for admission to his lost post. We regret, however, that
reflexion does not enable us to do so, and therefore the rule will be made
absolute unconditionally.

328

I think the purpose of section 4 of the Penal Code was to affirm the power of
the Supreme Court to deal with acts of misconduct (albeit limited in terms of
that section, to acts of malpractice), even though the misconduct was criminal
in character and may also have constituted an offence under the Penal Code. I
should like to refer to Stephens v. Hill (20) (on which I think section 4 of
the Penal Code was based). Lord Abinger, CB, explained the matter in the
following terms, where an attorney had attempted to win his case by persuading
a witness to keep away from the trial:

"I never understood that an attorney might not be struck off the roll for
misconduct in a cause in which he was the attorney, merely because the offence
imputed to him was of such a nature that he might have been indicted for it.
So long as I have known Westminster Hall, I never heard of such a rule as
that; but in the case of applications calling upon an attorney to answer the
matters of an affidavit, I have known Lord Kenyon and also Lord Ellenborough
frequently say, you cannot have a rule for that purpose, because the
misconduct you impute to the man is indictable; but you may have one to strike
him off the roll. Now an attorney who has been guilty of cheating his client,
or the opposite party, in such a manner as to render himself indictable, is
unfit to be allowed to remain on the roll, or to practise in any court; and I
see no objection, on principle, to the Court's removing him at once from it.
If indeed he were called on to answer the matters of an affidavit, he would
not by complying, be guilty of a contempt for which he might be punished by
attachment, and if the offence imputed to him were of an indictable nature, it
would be most unjust to compel him to do so; for which reason a rule to answer
the matters of an affidavit is never granted in such a case, but only a rule
to strike him off the roll, which gives him a full opportunity of clearing
himself from the imputation, if he can, while, on the other hand, it does not
compel him to criminate himself . . . In all cases where an attorney abuses
the process of the Court of which he is an officer, and his proceedings are of
such a nature as tend to defeat justice in the very cause in which he is
engaged professionally, I never heard that,, because by possibility he may
thereby have exposed himself to be indicted as a cheat or for

329

conspiracy, he is to be permitted to remain on the roll ... Such a rule would
be extremely injurious; for in no case could any remedy be had against the
attorney, unless the client would first prosecute him to conviction, until
which time he could not be struck off the roll or prevented from practising.
Where, indeed, the attorney is indicted for some matter not connected with the
practice of his profession as attorney, that also is a ground for striking him
off the roll, although in that case it cannot be done until after conviction .
. ."

Conviction for an offence is only a prima facie reason why this Court may act
in matters of this kind. An attorney whose misconduct is criminal in
character, whether it was done in pursuit of his profession or not, (this
Court has wider powers than those affirmed by section 4 of the Penal Code),
may be struck off the roll, suspended from practice, reprimanded, admonished
or advised, even though he had not been brought by the appropriate legal
process before a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and convicted; and
even though there is nothing to show that a prosecution is pending or
contemplated. (See _Re Edgar Edema_ (9); _Re Isaac Romey Abeydeera_ (21); _In
re a Proctor_ (22); In _re C. E. de S. Senaratne_ (23); Re _Donald
Dissanayake_ (24); _Re P. P. Wickremasinghe_ (18); _Re Rasanathan Nadesan_
(25); _Stephens v. Hill (supra); Anon (supra); Re Hill (supra); Re Vallance_
(26); _Anon (1894) 24 L. Jo 638. But cf. Short v Pratt_ (14) and _Re Knight_
(27)).

I might go further: If Moonesinghe had been charged with the commission of an
offence in a competent court and acquitted, he could and ought, nevertheless,
to have been dealt with by this Court, as the proctor was in _Re
Thirugnanasothy_ (28). See also _Re Garbett_ (29); _R v. Southerton_ (30); _Re
W.H.B._ (31). In Re Thirugnanasothy a proctor had been acquitted of criminal
misappropriation by a District Court. He was, nevertheless, struck off the
roll, G. P. A. Silva, SPJ., explaining at p.239 that although the reasons for
the acquittal were "sound", they were technical in nature".

On the other hand, if an attorney answering a Rule has evidence, besides that
produced at the trial and conviction, which shows conclusively that he was not
guilty of the crime or offence whereof he was convicted, he is not debarred in
proceedings of this nature from bringing forward that evidence to avoid
becoming amenable to the

330

disciplinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This does not mean that if a
conviction if in full force and effect, that is, if it has been affirmed in
appeal or has not been appealed against, within the time allowed for
appealing, this Court will permit the matter to be reargued before it on the
evidence upon which that conviction was based; it will not rehear a matter
which has been heard and determined, or allow argument that evidence which was
believed by the court should not have been believed or that evidence
disbelieved by it should have been accepted. The attorney is debarred from
traversing the conviction or from rearguing the findings of fact on which the
conviction was based, but it would be open to him to confess and avoid, that
is to show by extra matter that, in spite of the conviction, he yet was not
guilty of the crime or offence whereof he was convicted, whereby he would be
liable under Section 42 of the Judicature Act. (See per _Macdonell, CJ in Re
Kandiah_ (32). See also _In re A. P. Jayatilleke_ (33) per Dalton, ACJ. The
question was raised but not decided in _Attorney-General v. Senaratne_.(34) CF
_Re Wilbert (supra) at p_. 32).

Conviction for an offence is a prima facie reason why the Supreme Court should
act in the exercise of its disciplinary powers in terms of section 42 of the
Judicature Act. (Cf. per _Howard, CJ in Re Brito_ (35)). In the absence of
contrary evidence, the Court may proceed to act on it in disciplinary
proceedings. (E. see per Garvin, SPJ in _Re Solomon Victor Ranasinghe_ (8)).
However, it is only a prima facie reason that might move the Supreme Court to
exercise its disciplinary jurisdiction. This Court is the sole arbiter of the
question whether or not a person is fit to remain on the roll and, upon what
conditions. (Cf. Re wilbers (supra) at p.32). In the determination of that
question, its powers are unfettered and untrammelled by the findings of fact,
their interpretation, and the decisions of other judges and tribunals on the
basis of those facts. (Cf. _Re Thirugnanasothy_ (28); _Undugodage v.
Rasanathan_ (36)). The reasons are not difficult to understand.

The objectives of this Court in exercising its disciplinary jurisdiction and
the objectives of a court exercising its criminal jurisdiction are quite
different. Although section 4 of the Penal Code refers to the power of the
Court to punish attorneys-at-law, and despite the fact that many an eminent
Judge, pace, undoubtedly through a mere lapsus calami, has sometimes referred
to

331

"punishment" in the exercise of the disciplinary powers of the Court, (e.g.
see per _Rose. CJ. In re Senaratne_ (23); per _G. P. A. Silva, SPJ in Re
Thirugnanasothy_ (28); per _Atukorale, J in Re Arthenayake_ (37) and per
_Ranasinghe, CJ in R. Nadesan_ (25)); and although the need for orders that
have a deterrent effect was referred to by _Macdonell, CJ. in Re Abeydeera_
(38), we ought not to be influenced by punitive considerations in making
orders in matters of this kind. For the purposes of this Court, in matters of
the kind before us, it is not the punishment of a guilty attorney-at-law, but
the consideration of the question whether he is a proper person to be
continued on the roll that concerns us. (See per _Lord Mansfield in Ex parte
Brounsall_ (39); per _Gratiaen, J in Re an Advocate_ (40); per _Basnayake, CJ
in Re Fernando_ (13); per _Fernando, J in Re Wilbert_ (2)). It is because of
that reason that a person may be struck off the roll for an offence committed
even before admission ( _Re Bradley_ (41); See also Re Wilbert, supra, at
p.30), at any rate, if the application to remove him is made soon after
admission. (Anon. (1831) 2 B & Ad 766; cf,. _Re Page_ (42)).

In Ex parte Brounsall (supra), an attorney had been convicted of stealing a
guinea. He had been branded in the hand and confined in a house of correction
for nine months. Five years later, although he had committed no other act of
misconduct, the question was raised whether he was an unfit person to practise
as an attorney. Lord Mansfield said: "This application is not in the nature of
a second trial or a new punishment. But the question is, whether, after the
conduct of this man, it is proper that he should continue a member of a
profession which should stand free from, all suspicion." Although his Lordship
was of the view that the rule should be made absolute, "as it was for the
dignity of the profession that a solemn opinion should be given", others were
consulted and on June 27, 1778 Lord Mansfield said: "We have consulted all the
Judges upon this case, and they are unanimously of opinion, that the
defendant's having been burnt in the hand, is no objection to his being struck
off the roll. And it is on this principle; that he is an unfit person to
practise as an attorney. It is not by way of punishment; but the Court on such
cases exercise their discretion, whether a man whom they have formerly
admitted, is a proper person to be continued on the roll or not. Having been
convicted of felony, we think the defendant is not a fit person to be an
attorney. Therefore let the rule be made absolute."

332

As Lord Esher, MR, in Re Weare (supra) at p.442 observed, Lord Mansfield did
not lay down any new law, but the law was "very authoritatively laid down by
him with his usual felicity of expression." Referring to Lord Mansfield's
statement of the law, Lord Esher (at p.443) said: "There it seems, to me, is
the whole law on the matter laid down as distinctly as can be, and in a way
the propriety of which nobody, as it appears to me, can doubt."

The italics in the words quoted from the decision of Lord Mansfield are mine.
The first group of words I have italicized in the observations of Lord
Mansfield were quoted with approval by Garvin, J in _Attorney General v.
Ellawala_ (43).

Fernando, J ( _Atukorale and Bandaranayake, JJ agreeing) in Re Wilbert_ (2)
said:

.....these proceedings are not criminal or penal in character, but are
intended to protect the public, litigants, and the legal profession itself.
Over half a century ago it was observed in _Solicitor-General v. Ariyaratne_
(44) that these proceedings involve not a question of punishing a man, but
quite a different question, ought a person against whom such offences have
been proved, remain on the roll of an honourable profession?

Since our purposes are different, our respective methods of ascertaining and
evaluating the facts correspondingly vary: A court acting in the exercise of
its criminal jurisdiction is concerned with finding out whether the
specifically, precisely and narrowly defined ingredients of an offence have
been proved beyond reasonable doubt, strictly in accordance with the formal
rules of evidence and procedure laid down for that purpose. If it finds a
person guilty, it pronounces a sentence of punishment. The punishments it may
impose are statutorily prescribed (see Chapter III of the Penal Code), and
may, in certain instances, include death, rigorous or simple imprisonment,
whipping forfeiture of property or fine. Our task, in the exercise of the
disciplinary jurisdiction vested in us in terms of section 42 of the
judicature Act, is the determination, based on an appropriate degree of proof,
having regard to the nature of the charge, whether a person we formerly
admitted should be struck off the roll, suspended, reprimanded, admonished, or
advised for his

333

unprofessional conduct. In the performances of that task, this Court proceeds
with its investigations under section 42 of the Judicature Act, unfettered by
invariable and inflexible standards of proof (Cf. in Re Wilbert (supra) at
p.29), or of rigid rules pertaining to procedure and the admissibility of
evidence. (Cf. _Attorney-General v. Ellawala_ (43)).

It has not been established that Moonesinghe has been convicted for the
offence of criminal breach of trust. However, I have explained that conviction
for an offence is neither necessary, nor indeed, invariably sufficient, to
make a person amenable to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court.

We have also seen that the objects and intentions of a criminal prosecution,
on the one hand, and the objects and intentions of proceedings of this nature,
on the other, are altogether different. Although to us, as lawyers, the phrase
"criminal breach of trust" Wan everyday, usual and ordinary, sense means
criminal breach of trust as defined in the Penal Code, I must in these
proceedings, reject that meaning, since another meaning is more agreeable and
appropriate to the object and intention of these, thank goodness, rare,
unusual and extraordinary legal proceedings. (Cf. Maxwell, Interpretation of
Statutes 11th Ed, 1962 at p. 53). The phrase "criminal breach of trust" in the
Rule is not used, in a technical sense, but in its ordinary sense, as when it
is used by members of the public generally, that is, in its popular sense. In
the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether the
ingredients of "criminal breach of trust" set out in section 388 of the Penal
Code have been established.

As to whether Moonesinghe was guilty of criminal breach of trust in the sense
relevant to these proceedings, I have no doubt whatsoever in affirmatively
answering that question. In my view, Moonesinghe acted in a way that was not
straightforward. Rather, he acted in a way that was knavish and wanting in
probity. He persuaded Mrs. Chandratileke, both by reason of his membership of
an honourable profession and by communication, to employ him in a manner
implying confidence. He then put to wrong use or uses a sum of money given to
him by Mrs. Chandratileke in flagrant disregard of their understanding,
agreement or contract. And further, on account

334

of such confidence, and on account of an insincere and false assurance to
eventually repay her in full, Moonesinghe persuaded Mrs. Chandratileke to
accept a post-dated cheque, by way of repayment in part of the sum of money
she had given him, which Moonesinghe probably believed at the time he issued
it, and certainly knew long before it was due for presentation, would be
dishonoured.

Would my holding Moonesinghe guilty of criminal breach of trust in a non-
technical sense cause him prejudice, so much so that I should refrain from
making a finding in that regard? In _Undugodage v. Rasanathan_ (36) an
attorney-at-law had been charged with the misappropriation of certain sums of
money. With regard to one charge, the Court found that there had been no
misappropriation as alleged in the Rule. With regard to the other charge of
misappropriation, Atukorale, J (H. A. G. de Silva and Jameel, J. agreeing)
held that, although that act of misconduct "would, to say the least,
constitute the clearest instance of a malpractice within the meaning of
Section s.42 (2) of the Judicature Act" which was sufficient to warrant his
removal from office, yet this had not been raised before the disciplinary
committee, and since the attorney would be gravely prejudiced if it were
raised at the stage of the disciplinary inquiry before the Supreme Court, the
Court did not deem it "proper or possible" to "reach a finding adverse to the
respondent" on that charge. Would Moonesinghe have been prejudiced by any
ambiguity? I do not think so. Perhaps he believed that the Rule was not
concerned with criminal breach of trust in a technical sense but rather in a
non-technical sense? Why did he retain counsel to appear for him in certain
criminal charges against him (although unrelated to this case) but not in the
matter of the Rule? I think he knew the difference between the technical and
non-technical sense of the phrase and understood perfectly well the sense in
which the charge of criminal breach of trust was made in the Rule. I would
certainly not have been prepared, if an objection had been raised, to smother
or hush up these proceedings on the basis that "criminal breach of trust" has
more than one meaning.

In _Attorney-General v. Ellawala_ (43), the Court (Garvin, Dalton and Lyall
Grant, JJ) said that:

335

The power of this Court to investigate charges against members of the legal
profession is unfettered by rigid rules of procedure relating to the
initiation of such proceedings or by any strict definition of or limitation as
to the nature of the material upon which alone such proceedings may be
founded. Whenever in the opinion of this Court an occasion has arisen to
investigate a charge against an advocate or proctor which, if true, renders
him liable to suspension or removal from office it has the power to initiate
proceedings for the investigation of the charge. It is essential, not only in
the interests of the profession, but of the public, individual members of
which are constrained daily to commit their most vital interests to members of
the legal profession, that cases of misconduct, and especially of
dishonourable conduct, which come under or are brought to the notice of this
Court should be fully investigated, and that their investigation should not be
hampered or burked by mere technicalities.

I would respectfully agree. However, I should like to add this: In the framing
of Rules nisi, in arriving at conclusions on the facts, and in making orders,
this Court has been cautious and restrained. I might mention a few examples.
In Re Donald Dissanayake (supra) where an attorney dishonestly converted his
client's money to his own use, and there was no conviction, the Rule issued
was in respect of deceit and malpractice. In Re Isaac Romey Abeydeera (supra)
in similar circumstances, the proctor was simply. charged in the Rule with
"misconduct" that was said to have made him amenable to the disciplinary
jurisdiction of the Court in terms of the relevant statutory provisions at
that time. In Re Nadesan (supra) there was no conviction, but the Rule charged
the attorney with criminal breach of trust. Even though he pleaded guilty, the
Court, in making its order, dealt with him on the basis that he was a "person
who has been guilty of misappropriation, deceit and malpractice." H. N. G.
Fernando, CJ and Samerawickrame and Weeramantry, JJ in Re Dharmalingam (supra)
found a proctor who had misappropriated his client's survey fees guilty of
malpractice and no more, although Seneviratne, J. in Re Arthenayake (at p.346)
was of the view that the facts of Dharmalingam disclosed criminal
misappropriation as defined by Section 386 of the Penal Code. Atukorale and De
Alwis,

336

JJ in Re Arthenayake (supra) adopted the view that in Re Dharmalingam the
proctor was guilty of malpractice. In Re Wilbert (supra) Fernando, J
(Atukorale and Bandaranayake, JJ agreeing), although "not obliged to do so",
(see at p.29) refrained from making a finding on the charge of dishonestly
using as genuine a certificate known to be forged, since criminal proceedings
in that regard were contemplated, the attorney being struck off on other
grounds.

The question that remains is this: whether after the conduct of this man, what
is the appropriate order that should be made in this case? As Chief Justice
Sir Alan Rose observed in _Re Senaratne_ (23), it is "always difficult in
matters of this kind" to arrive at a decision on that question.

Although Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act only refers to the options of
removal or suspension where an attorney has been guilty of deceit,
malpractice, crime or offence, striking off the roll or suspension are not the
inevitable and invariable orders this Court may make.

The appropriate order is a matter within the plenary and absolute discretion
of the Court. Esher, Mr, in Re Weare (supra) - a case followed with approval
by our courts (e.g. see In re Jayatileke said):

I have no doubt that the Court might in some cases say, "Under these
circumstances we shall do no more than admonish him"; or the Court might say,
"We shall do no more than admonish him and make him pay the costs of the
application"; or the Court might suspend him, or the Court might strike him
off the roll. The discretion of the Court in each particular case is absolute.
I think the law as to the power of the Court is quite clear."

The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its absolute and plenary discretion in
this matter, having regard to the special circumstances of each case,
including primarily, but not exclusively, the nature of the disciplinary
offence in question, has made orders ranging from removal, through suspension,
to merely stating in strong terms what was expected of the lawyer concerned.
In searching for the right decision to make in these matters, a feel, a
general sense, based on

337

what the Court has done in the past, (not merely in cases assumed to be
"exactly in point" \- if it were ever possible in matters of this kind to find
such cases), is helpful. Not one case was cited in this, or in any other
connection, by learned counsel in these proceedings; but this is what I have
found. I hope it will be of some use to others.

In general, (but not invariably or inevitably - See e.g. _Solicitor-General v.
Chelvatamby_ (9); _Re Aiyadurai_ (11) and _Re Gaston K. de Vaz_ (45) referred
to below and see also the observations in Re Jayatileke (supra) at p. 377)
conviction for a criminal offence, whether connected with his character as an
attorney or not, and whether involving money matters or not, makes a person
unfit to hold the office of an attorney-at-law, and the Court orders removal
from the roll. (E.g. see _Re Solomon Victor Ranasinghe_ (6) where an advocate
convicted of criminal breach of trust was struck off; _Solicitor-General v
Cooke_ (10), _Solicitor-General v Abdul Cader_ (12), and _Re Fernando_ (13),
where proctors convicted of criminal breach of trust were struck off; _Re
Kandiah_ (32), where an advocate convicted of an offence under Section 8 of
the Opium Ordinance No. 5 of 1910 was struck off; _Re A. P. Jayatilleke_ (33)
a proctor convicted of unlawful assembly was struck off; _Attorney-General v.
Ariyaratne_ (46) a proctor convicted of culpable homicide was struck off; _Re
Brito_ (35) a proctor convicted under the Post Office Ordinance for sending a
post card with words of an indecent and grossly offensive character was struck
off. See also Anon (1815) 1 Chitty's Practice Reports, 1770-1822, 557 n; _Ex
parte Brounsall_ (39); _Re Weare_ (7); _Re Cooper_ (47), cf. _Re Watts, Ex
parte Incorporated Law Society_ (48); _Re Jellicoe_ (49) Ibid; _Re A
Solicitors_ (50); _Re a Solicitor_ (51); _Re a Solicitor_ (52).)

Even if there is no conviction, yet if the attorney's conduct is otherwise
criminal in character, the Court would usually order the removal of his name
from the roll, if it was of a particularly reprehensible nature. Thus in
_Attorney-General v. Ellawala_ (43) a proctor who had accepted a gratification
in his capacity as a member of the district committee appointed under the
Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance was struck off for being guilty of "gross
misconduct involving deceit", although he had not been convicted of any penal
offence. Similarly, the Court would strike off an attorney guilty of criminal
misconduct, especially if it was done in the exercise of his

338

 professional functions. (E.g. See _Re Edgar Edema_ (19) where a proctor who
misappropriated his client's money was removed from the roll; _Re Isaac Romey
Abeydeera_ (21) where a proctor who had dishonestly appropriated his client's
money, although not convicted of criminal breach of trust, was struck off; _Re
Donald Dissanayake_ (24) where an attorney had misappropriated his client's
money and was guilty of deceit and malpractice which he explained was due to
his "helpless addiction to liquor", he was struck off, Samarakoon, CJ
observing that "Those whose professional lives are ruled by Bacchus are a
danger to the public and it is unsafe to allow them to hold themselves out to
the public as licensed attorneys-at-law; _Re Rasanathan Nadesan_ (25), where
an attorney was guilty of misappropriation of his client's money, deceit,
professional negligence and malpractice was struck off).

Although criminal misconduct prima facie makes a person unfit to be an
attorney-at-law, this, however, is not an inflexible rule. (Cf. In re _A. P.
Jayatilleke_ (33) following In _Re Weare (supra); In re a Proctor_ ,(53); _Re
a Solicitor, Ex parte incorporated Law Society_ (54). The Court, perhaps,
ought not to pass over the matter without marking its sense of the misconduct,
but it may certainly decide on some other order without going to the extent of
striking him off the roll. (E.g. see Re Hill (supra) followed in The
Solicitor-General v. Chelvatamby (supra) where a proctor guilty of criminal
breach of trust was suspended and ordered to pay costs). The appropriate order
is a matter for the Court in the exercise of its discretion having regard to
the circumstances of the case. Lord Esher, MR, in Re Weare, (supra), at p.445
explained the matter in the following terms:

Where a man has been convicted of a criminal offence, that prima facie at all
events does make him a person unfit to be a member of the honourable
profession. That must not be carried to the length of saying that whenever a
solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence the Court is bound to
strike him off the roll. That was argued on behalf of the Incorporated Law
Society in the case of In re a Solicitor, Ex parte Law Society. (supra). It
was there contended that where a solicitor had been convicted of a crime it
followed as a matter of course that he must be struck off; but Baron Pollock
and Manisty, J., held that,

339

although his being convicted of a crime prima facie made him liable to be
struck off the roll, the Court had a discretion and must inquire into what
kind of a crime it is of which he has been convicted, and the Court may punish
him to a less extent than he had been punished in the criminal proceeding.

In the same case, Lopes, LJ, at p.449 fin. - 450 said as follows:

It is perfectly clear that the mere fact that the person has been convicted of
a criminal offence does not make it imperative on the Court to strike him off
the roll. There are criminal offences and criminal offences. For instance, one
can imagine a solicitor guilty of an assault of such a disgraceful character
that it would be incumbent on the Court to strike him off the roll. On the
other hand, one can imagine an assault of a comparatively trifling
description, where in all probability the Court would not think it its duty to
interfere. The same observation would arise with regard to indictments for
libel. There are libels and libels, some of which would compel the Court to
act under the plenary power it possesses, others where the Court would
hesitate before it so acted.

Moonesinghe is guilty of deceit. Deceitful conduct, which is not necessarily
criminal in nature, has resulted in various orders: In _Re M. Shelton Perera_
(55) a proctor who gained admission to the Law College by deceitfully leading
the Principal to believe he was not employed was suspended for three years.
_In Re a Proctor_ (22) a proctor who had misappropriated money without a
criminal or dishonest intention was suspended for three months and ordered to
pay costs. In _Re Dharmalingam_ (57) (supra) a proctor who had misappropriated
the survey fees deposited with him and was merely guilty of malpractice was
suspended for four months. Where deceitful conduct, as in the case before us,
is criminal in character, the order has usually been for removal. Thus in Re
_Dematagodage Don Harry WiIbert_ (2) an attorney who provided forged
documentation for admission to the Law College was struck off; In Re Edgar
Edema (supra), Re Donald Dissanayake (supra), and in Re R. Nadesan, (supra)
lawyers guilty of misappropriation and deceit of a criminal character were
struck off even though they had hot been convicted. In Re Thirugananasothy

340

(supra) though acquitted, the Court struck off a lawyer guilty of deceit of a
criminal character.

Acts of malpractice have also been variously dealt with. In Re A. V. de Silva
(1934) an advocate who was guilty of touting was removed from the roll; _In Re
de Soysa_ (56) a proctor in his professional capacity signing false
certificates to enable persons to obtain identity cards was suspended for
three years; _In Re Arthenayake_ (37) an attorney who had been guilty of gross
negligence in the discharge of his professional duties and in correspondence
with his client indulged in unbecoming language, was suspended for two years;
In _Re a Proctor_ (22); where a proctor without criminal intention had
negligently misappropriated his client's money, was suspended for six months
and ordered to pay costs; In _Re Dharmalingam_ (57) a proctor who
misappropriated the survey fees deposited with him with the result that his
client's case was dismissed, was suspended for four months; In re Edwin Bevan
(1897) a proctor who signed and issued blank letters of demand was suspended
for three months; In Re two Proctors (1935) where two proctors were guilty of
deceit and malpractice in drawing up the terms of settlement submitted to a
court, one of them was suspended for six months and the other for three
months; In _re Simon Appu_ (58) a proctor signing a plaint drawn by a petition
drawer was suspended for three months; _In the matter of K_ (59) a proctor who
appeared drunk in court was suspended for three months; In _re Dharmaratne_
(60) a proctor who had prepared a petition of appeal in false and scandalous
terms insulting the judge against whose order his client was appealing, was
suspended for a month; In Re the complaint of Dr. C. J. Kriskenbeck against A.
J. a Proctor of the _Supreme Court_ (61) where an advocate who was found
guilty of "the small tyranny of cross-examination and bullying a witness, was
in strong terms told what the expected standards were and the matter was
dropped; In The _Solicitor-General v. Jayawickreme_ (62) where when an
advocate was guilty of malpractice for dealing directly with a client and not
through the intervention of a proctor, the case being the first of its kind in
this country, the Court did no more than make the Rule absolute.

In exercising the Court's disciplinary powers, many a thing has been taken
into consideration. In _re Batuwantudawa_ (63), in refusing to

341

re-enroll an advocate who had been convicted of forgery and cheating and
sentenced to imprisonment. Dias, SPJ said that there was a solemn duty cast
upon the Court to make it clear, "particularly at a time when public morality
is at a low ebb", that it is not an easy matter for a person convicted of
offences of this kind to be restored to the ranks of an honourable profession,
the good name of which he has degraded by his conduct." i have no evidence
before me of the state of "public morality". And in any event one might with
Terence (Phormio 454) say Quot homines tot sententiae; suo quoique mos. So
many men, so many opinions; his a law to each.

Account has also been taken of the fact that the attorney was not aware of the
wrongful nature of his act. (See Re Simon Appu (supra); Re a proctor 1933 36
NLR at 16). There is no suggestion here that Moonesinghe was ignorant of the
reprehensible nature and quality of his acts. The fact that the attorney was
acting under pressure ( _Re a Proctor_ (53)) or had domestic problems at the
time ( _Re Dhramalingam_ (57)) on certain occasions moved the Court to take a
lenient view. However, in _Re Nadesan_ (25), the fact that the delinquent
attorney was mentally depressed on account of the ill-health of his mother and
mother-in-law did not prevent the Court from striking off the attorney for
misappropriating his client's money. The age of the attorney, (see Re Simon
Appu (supra); Re Aiyadurai (supra); Re Chelvatamby (supra),) and his years of
standing at the Bar (e.g. see Re Simon Appu; Re Aiyadurai (supra); Re a
Proctor (1933) 36 NLR 9; Solicitor-General v. Chelvatamby (supra); _Re de
Soysa_ (56)) have also been considered. In Re Fernando (supra) however,
Basnayake, CJ regarded long standing at the Bar as being merely an
"unfortunate" circumstance. I have no evidence in this case of the age or
standing of Moonesinghe, nor of any stresses that unbalanced him. The long
interval between the commission of the offence and the consideration by the
Court has also been taken into account. In Re Thirugananasothy (supra) at
p.239 it was held that delay in complaining, unless explained was a mitigatory
factor. In Re Gaston R de Vaz (supra) the lapse of fourteen years led the
Court to treat the matter as one of re-enrolment. There has been no such lapse
of time in the matter before us. Mrs. Chandratileke acted with sufficient
celerity to bring this matter before us.

342

Where there has been misappropriation, although Basnayake, CJ in Re Fernando
(supra) at p.235 considered the fact of restitution to be irrelevant when the
Court is exercising its disciplinary powers, repayment being regarded as a
mere discharge of one's civil liabilities, restitution has been taken into
account in other cases. In Solicitor-General v. Chelvatamby(supra) restitution
was considered a mitigatory factor although belated and "not in consequence of
contrition". In Re Aiyadurai (supra) at p.511 the fact that restitution was
intended was held to warrant "some degree of leniency"; In Re P, P.
Wickremasinghe (18), the fact that the money had been paid back with interest
was regarded as a mitigatory circumstance. In _Re Wijesinghe_ (64) restitution
was considered in the matter of an application for re-enrolment. In Solicitor-
General v. Cooke (supra) Soertsz, J at p. 207 said that although restitution
cannot be ignored, the weight to be given to that fact depended on the
circumstances. On the other hand the refusal to make good the loss (Re
Thirugnanasothy (supra) at p.240) or the evasion of payment "under cover of a
series of fictitious stories and fraudulent excuses" (Re Edgar Edema (supra);
or an unfulfilled promise of repayment (Re Abeydeera (supra) have been held to
aggravate the offence. In the matter before me, Moonesinghe's pretended
partial restitution by issuing a post-dated cheque, which he always believed
or knew was a worthless piece of paper, and which he was willing to permit
Mrs. Chandratileke to present for payment when he knew that his account had
been closed, is conduct that aggravates his offence.

Although a charge will not be dropped because the complainant has made a
private arrangement with the attorney (see Anon (1863) 9 LT 299; Anon (1873)
19 Sol. Jo 635, yet the fact that the complainant Indicates an intention not
to pursue the matter may be considered in mitigation. (E.g. _Re P. P.
Wickremasinghe_ (18). Understandably, Mrs. Chandratilake has not shown any
intention of pardoning Moonesinghe.

The amount involved is of little or no consequence if the offence is serious.
(E.g. Re Abeydeera (supra). In the matter before us the offence is serious and
the amount involved is considerable.

One of the most important considerations in matters of this sort is the
professional relationship of the attorney to the complainant. An

343

act which is ordinarily reprehensible deserves to be more severely marked if
it is done by an attorney-at-law in pursuit of his profession. In _Re Hill_
(16), Blackburn, J. at p. 548 said that in considering the order the Court
should make "It always should be considered whether the particular wrong done
is connected with the character of an attorney. The offence morally may not be
greater, but still, if done in the character of an attorney, is more dangerous
to the suitors, and should be more severely marked." If the misconduct with
which an attorney is charged and of which he has been found guilty was
committed in his capacity as an attorney-at-law, it is an aggravating
circumstance. (See Re Ranasinghe (supra); Solicitor-General v. Abdul Cader
(supra); Re Fernando; Re Edgar Edema (supra); Re Abeydeera (supra); Re Donald
Dissanayake (supra); Re Nadesan (supra); _Re Hill_ (16); _Re D_ (65); Re Weare
(supra) at p. 444; See also in re _A. P. Jayatileke_ (33)).

Was there something Moonesinghe did as an attorney-at-law in the course of his
professional employment towards a client, or towards a court or to an opponent
in litigation or, in a non-contentious matter, the "other side"? There was no
litigation, no court, or "other side" in this matter. Nor was there a client-
attorney relationship. It is evident from Mrs. Chandratileke's letter to the
Chief Justice as well as from her affidavit that the organization known as T &
M Associates (Pvt) Ltd. was not seen by her as a firm of attorneys-at-law, but
rather, as she says, "a financial institution" which she claims ought to have
been registered under the Control of Finance Companies Act (Cap. 329). In his
application to open his bank account (P8), Moonesinghe left the column
relating to his "Occupation, Profession or Employment" without any entry; and
in the Signature Card pertaining to his bank account (P9) he described his
"Designation/Occupation/Profession", not as an attorney but as a
"businessman". There was no relationship of attorney and client between
Moonesinghe and Chandratileke. The conduct in question, in my view, was not in
pursuit of his profession as an attorney-at-law and does not constitute
professional misconduct. This is a mitigatory circumstance. Thus in
_Solicitor-General v. Chelvatamby_ (9) reported sub. nom. _In re a Proctor_
(53), a proctor convicted of criminal breach of trust but not of property
entrusted qua a proctor was suspended for twelve months and ordered to pay
costs. In _Re Aiyadurai_ (11) a proctor

344

convicted for criminal breach of trust of property not entrusted to him in his
professional capacity was suspended for six months.

On the other hand, the response of Moonesinghe to the Rule has been most
unsatisfactory. There has been no apology, or expression of regret or any sign
of repentance, and he has failed to explain his conduct or show cause why he
should not be dealt with by this Court. These are matters we should not
ignore. (See Re Simon Appu (supra); Solicitor-General v. Jayawickrama (supra)
at p. 322; Re Arthenayake at p. 334-335; Re Wilbert (supra) at 34). In the
matter before us Moonesinghe's disrespect for this court by failing to submit
his observations when they were called for by the Court and by failing to
respond to the Rule was exacerbated by his attempt to stall the proceedings by
pretending to act through a firm of attorneys in the Seychelles.

How then should we deal with such a man in the circumstances of this matter?
It has been said that the Supreme Court has inherent disciplinary powers over
its officers. (Cf. _Re Arthenayake_ (37) per Seneviratne, J; _Re Dematagodage
Don Henry Wilbert_ (2) per Fernando, J). It also does, and has always had,
wide statutory powers to deal with its officers in matters of discipline.
Article XXIV of the Royal Charter of Justice of 1801, which set up the Supreme
Court of Judicature of this Island empowered the Court to "approve, admit and
enrol" advocates and proctors, and gave the Court the adjunct power to remove
"on reasonable cause" those who had been so admitted. The Supreme Court was
empowered by Article 17 of the Charter of Justice of 1833 to admit as Proctors
or as Advocates of the Supreme Court persons "of good repute" and competent
knowledge and ability. No reference was made to the power of removal or
suspension; but the Court did exercise those powers. For instance, in _Re
Dharmaratne_ (60) it suspended a proctor who was found guilty of gross and
culpable misconduct. In Re Edgar Edema (19) the Court struck off the name of a
proctor from the roll for misappropriating his client's money for his own use.

Section 16 of The Courts Ordinance No. 1 of 1889 gave the Court the power to
admit "persons of good repute and competent knowledge and ability" as
Advocates or as Proctors of the Court. Section 17 provided that "Every person
so admitted and enrolled,

345

 who shall be guilty of any deceit, malpractice, crime or offence, may be
suspended from practice or removed from office by three Judges of the Supreme
Court sitting together."

The Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973, removed the distinction
between the two branches of the profession, and through Section 33 empowered
the Supreme Court to admit and enrol as attorneys-at-law "persons of good
repute and of competent knowledge and ability." Section 35 of the
Administration of Justice Law provided that "Every attorney-at-law who shall
be guilty of any deceit, malpractice, offence or other conduct unworthy of an
attorney-at-law may be suspended from practice or removed from office by any
three Judges of the Supreme Court sitting together."

Section 62 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, inter alia, repealed the
provisions of Chapter 1 (Section 5-54) of the Administration of Justice Law
No. 44 of 1973. However, the Judicature Act of 1978 enacted in Section 40(1)
that the Supreme Court may, "in accordance with the rules for the time being
in force, admit and enrol as attorneys-at-law persons of good repute and of
competent knowledge and ability" In Section 42(2) the Judicature Act provides
that "Every person admitted and enrolled as an attorney-at-law who shall be
guilty of any deceit, malpractice, crime or offence may be suspended from
practice or removed from office by any three judges of the Supreme Court
sitting together." Although it was in terms similar to Section 35 of the
Administration of Justice Law, the words "or other conduct unworthy of an
attorney-at-law" were removed.

In Re Arthenayake (supra) Seneviratne, J. at p. 349 said that in the interests
of the Bar and that of the public Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act should
be amended by the addition of the words "or other conduct unworthy of an
attorney-at-law". Although the phrase certainly did usefully put the matter
beyond any doubt, and might have been retained out of an abundance of caution,
which, with great respect, is what I think Seneviratne, J. meant, I do not
think the removal of the words "or other conduct unworthy of an attorney-at-
law" has diminished the powers of the court, I am inclined to think that the
word "offence" in Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act has a wider meaning than
that given to it in the Penal Code and Code of

346

Criminal Procedure. I think it means disciplinary offence and includes,
conviction for an offence by a competent court, conduct that is criminal in
character, malpractice \- whether the professional misconduct involves moral
turpitude or not - , deceit, and all other forms of unprofessional conduct in
the sense of misconduct the Court ought to have taken into account at the time
of the admission of any attorney-at-law in deciding whether he was a person of
good repute.

In terms of Section 42(1) of the Judicature Act, the Supreme Court is given
the power to refuse to admit and enrol any person applying to be admitted as
an attorney-at-law, declaring in open court its reasons for such refusal, if
required to do so by the applicant. It is not without significance that the
power to refuse admission is embodied in a sub-section of the same section
containing the provisions regarding the power to suspend or remove admitted
attorneys, rather than in the section relating to admissions. The two matters
are inextricably linked. Disciplinary control over persons the Court has
admitted as attorneys-at-law is a power that is accessory or adjunct to its
power of admission. The power to admit and the power to exercise disciplinary
control by removal, suspension, reprimand, admonition or otherwise are
concomitant. I should venture to express the view that if Section 40 of the
Judicature Act merely gave the Court the power of admission without, as it
does in Section 42(2) Judicature Act, expressly conferring the powers of
removal and suspension, yet, as a matter of necessary implication, it also
gave the Court the power to remove, suspend or otherwise exercise disciplinary
powers over the persons appointed by the Court to act as its officers. (Cf.
Section 14(f) of the Interpretation Ordinance (Cap. 12)). As we have seen,
when it had no express statutory powers to do so under the Charter of Justice
of 1833, which in express terms only gave a power of admission, the Court had
no hesitation in suspending (Re Dharmaratne (supra)), and removing (see Re
Edgar Edema (supra)) members of the Bar.

And so, in deciding what is to be done, I think I should ask myself this: What
would I have done if Moonesinghe was an applicant for admission as an
attorney-at-law? As Howard, CJ observed in _Re Brito_ (35): "Our duty is to
regard the fitness of the respondent to continue in the profession from the
same angle as we should regard it

347

 if he was a candidate for enrolment." In _re Hill_ (16), where an attorney
had admitted embezzlement of money he had received, but not in his capacity as
an attorney, Cockburn, CJ said this:

"I should add, there is one consideration I omitted, and which, I think is
entitled to great weight. It is that put to us in the course of the
discussion, namely, that if those facts had been brought to our knowledge upon
the application for this gentleman's admission, we might have refused to admit
him; and I think the fact of his having been admitted does not alter his
position; having been admitted, we must deal with him as if he were now
applying for admission; and as in the case of a person applying for admission
as an attorney, we should have considered all the circumstances, and either
have refused to admit, or have suspended the admission for a certain time, so
where a person has once been admitted we are bound, although he was not acting
in the precise character of an attorney, to take notice of his misconduct."

In terms of the Supreme Court Rules (1978) (made under Article 136 of the
Constitution and published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 9/10 on November 8,
1978), every person who intends to apply for admission as an attorney-at-law
is required, inter alia, to submit to the Supreme Court a "certificate from
two or more Attorneys-at-law of at least seven years' standing that the
applicant is a person of good repute and that there is no impediment or
objection to his enrolment as an attorney-at-law." (Rule 68 (e)). When these
certificates have been filed, the Supreme Court is required by Rule 69 to
direct the Registrar "to inquire and report whether the applicant is of good
repute and whether there exists any impediment or objection to his enrolment
as an attorney-at-law, and upon such report the Supreme Court shall either
direct the applicant to be sworn or affirmed, and admitted and enrolled, or
make such other order as it may deem proper."

Persons have been admitted to the legal profession in this country always only
if they are persons of good repute. In the common or general estimate, and in
the relative estimation of the Court, and of admitted attorneys-at-law of
prescribed standing, a person must be regarded as decent and respectable
enough to be a member of an

348

honourable profession. The State, the court before whom he may appear, the
litigants and members of the public who may seek his advice or to whom they
may entrust their affairs, and the legal profession and its members, ought to
be considered.

First, I should consider the matter from the duty we owe the State. Let me
explain. Three salient features characterize the role of consulting
professions like the legal profession: (a) the provision of services related
to basic values; (b) self-regulation and (c) a monopoly or near monopoly of
services. The legal monopoly, or near monopoly, over our professional services
has this implication: We do not have a right to practice, but only a privilege
conferred by the State, provided certain conditions are fulfilled. The Supreme
Court has from the time of the Charter of Justice of 1801, been entrusted with
the task of determining what those conditions are, and conferring or taking
away the privilege of practising as a member of the legal profession. We,
therefore, owe the State a duty to ensure that only those who are qualified by
continuing to satisfy the conditions upon which they were admitted are
permitted to hold the franchise given to them. Mokerjee, _J in Emperor Rajani
Kanta Bose et al_ (66) followed with approval by Howard, CJ in Re Brito
(supra) at p. 532 said:

The practice of the law is not a business open to all who wish to engage in
it, it is a personal right or privilege limited to selected persons of good
character with special qualifications duly ascertained and certified; it is in
the nature of a franchise from the State conferred only for merit and may be
revoked whenever misconduct renders the person holding the licence unfit to be
entrusted with the powers and duties of his office. Generally speaking the
test to be applied is whether the misconduct is of such a description as shows
him to be an unfit and unsafe person to enjoy the privilege and manage the
business of others as (an attorney-at-law), in other words, unfit to discharge
the duties of his office and unsafe because unworthy of confidence.

The fact that the right to practice is a revocable franchise was also referred
to by Macdonell, CJ in Attorney-General v. Ariyaratne (supra). at p. 197.

349

One of the essential conditions for admission to the legal profession is that
a person must be of good repute. In the circumstances of this case,
Moonesinghe would certainly not have qualified. Therefore, in discharging the
obligations we owe the State, the franchise granted by us to Moonesinghe to
practise as a member of the legal profession must be revoked.

There is a duty on our part to the courts before whom he may practise to
ensure that an attorney will maintain the highest standards of conduct so that
he might be a person fit to be an officer of the court. He must be a person
who can be trusted by the Court. He must be able to command the confidence and
respect of the judges. See Re Fernando (supra) followed in Re Nadesan (supra).
Rule 51 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law)
Rules of 1988 provides that "An Attorney-at-Law shall not mislead or deceive
or permit his client to mislead or deceive in any way the Court or Tribunal
before which he appears." Moonesinghe is guilty of deceit. Having regard to
the nature and quality of Moonesinghe's dishonesty, which in my view is grave,
I do not think he could have been depended upon to observe the cardinal
principles enshrined in Rule 51\. I would, therefore, not have admitted him,
In the matter of an application to be readmitted and re-enrolled as an
_Advocate of the Supreme Court_ (67) Chief Justice Abrahams (Maartensz and
Moseley JJ agreeing) said at, p. 477: "We should of course be very careful in
admitting to the profession - members of which should observe the highest
standard of honour and trustworthiness - a man who has been guilty of crime
and dishonesty." And so, I do not think Moonesinghe is a fit person to
continue as an officer of this Court.

There is duty we owe the public. In _re Hill_ (16) Cockburn, CJ said: "When an
attorney does that which involves dishonesty, it is for the interest of
suitors that the Court should interpose and prevent a man guilty of such
misconduct from acting as an attorney of the Court." Significantly, in the
matter before us, Mrs. Chandratileke in her letter to the Chief Justice
complained that she and other members of the public invested large sums of
money with Moonesinghe "relying" on his "integrity as a professional man."
There was no client-attorney relationship in this case, but Mrs.
Chandratileke, was Justified, as a member of the public who had dealt with a
member of the legal

350

profession in whom she was entitled to repose confidence, in requesting the
Chief Justice to direct an inquiry to ascertain whether Moonesinghe was "a fit
and proper person to hold the office of attorney-at-law." She was entitled to
ask for an inquiry to ascertain whether the franchise given to this man should
be withdrawn. In _Re C. D. de S. Senaratne_ (23) a proctor who was guilty of
deceit and negligence was suspended and ordered to pay costs. Rose, CJ
(Nagalingam, SPJ, and K. D. de Silva, JJ agreeing) held at p. 100 that "the
interests of the profession and the public demand a suitable recognition of
the respondent's misconduct" even though the complainant had merely suffered
"inconvenience, annoyance and anxiety." Similarly in Solicitor-General v.
Cooke (supra) (followed per Ranasinghe, CJ. in Re Nadesan (supra)), Soertsz,
J. ordered that a proctor convicted of criminal breach of trust be struck off
because "the interests of the public and the prestige of the profession to
which the respondent belongs" required it. (see also Attorney-General v.
Ellawala (supra) at p.18).

In _Re Fernando_ (13), a proctor had been convicted of criminal breach of
trust and dishonest misappropriation of property. It was argued that the money
was not entrusted to him in his capacity as a proctor. Basnayake, CJ. (Pulle
and Fernando, JJ. agreeing) followed the decision in The _Solicitor-General v.
Abdul Cader_ (12) and said as follows:

The evidence in the case which we have perused leave no room for doubt that
the clients concerned came to him to obtain his services as a professional man
and not in any other capacity. But even if the assumption of learned counsel
is correct, it makes no difference. The jurisdiction this Court exercises
under Section 17 of the Courts Ordinance has nothing to do with punishment.
The power to remove or suspend a proctor from his office is one that is meant
to be exercised for the protection of the profession and the public and for
the purpose of maintaining a high code of conduct among those whom this Court
holds out as its officers to whom the public may entrust their affairs with
confidence. If a proctor is adequately to perform the functions of his office
and serve the interests of his clients, he should be able to command the

351

confidence and respect of Judges, of his fellow-practitioners and of his
clients. When a proctor is convicted of a criminal offence, more especially of
an offence involving his honesty and fidelity, it must inevitably mean the
loss of that confidence and respect without which he can no longer adequately
perform the functions of his office. Such a person this Court cannot hold out
to suitors and others "(the emphasis is mine)" as a person in whom they may
with safety place their confidence and who can be trusted to advise them, and
to undertake their affairs ... It is unfortunate that the respondent should
find himself in this situation after nearly 20 years in his profession. But
the interests of the profession and the public which are paramount require
that he should be removed from his office...

Although Cockburn, CJ in Re Hill (supra) referred to the interest of
"suitors", it is clear that criminal misconduct and deceit, whether it be
connected with his character as an attorney-at-law or not, may render him
unfit to be an attorney-at-law. (See R v. Southerton (supra) at p.143; _Re
King_ (68); _Re Hall, Dollond v. Johnson_ (69); _Re Blake_ (70); _Re Strong_
(71); _Re Hopper_ (72); _Re Weare_ (7). Indeed the disciplinary powers of the
Court remain as long as a person's name is on the roll and does not depend on
whether he has ceased to practise. (Cf. _Myers v Elman_ (73) , Sittingbourne
and Sheerness _Rail Co. v Lawson_ (74); _Simes v Gibbs_ (75); _Brendon v
Spiro_ (76); _Re a Solicitor, Ex parte Incorporated Law Society_ (77); _Ex
parte Champ_ (78) ; I do not think that Cockburn, CJ intended his remarks to
be confined to the misconduct of attorneys-at-law acting for litigants. The
case before the Chief Justice related to the misconduct of an attorney by
misappropriating funds entrusted to him as a clerk to a firm of attorneys.
However, the Chief Justice did not hesitate to suspend the man for twelve
months. That the Chief Justice was using the term to refer to any person who
may deal with an attorney, whether a professional client or not, is clear from
his earlier statement in _Re Blake_ (70) . In that case, as in the matter
before us, the matter arose out of a loan transaction where there was no
attorney-client relationship. In that case, the Chief Justice said:

I am of opinion that Blake is amenable to the summary jurisdiction of this
Court, although the misconduct of which he has been guilty did not arise in a
matter strictly between

352

attorney and client, but out of a simple loan transaction. I proceed on the
general ground that where an attorney is shown to have been guilty of gross
fraud, although the fraud is neither such as renders him liable to an
indictment, nor was committed by him while the relation of attorney and client
was subsisting between him and the person defrauded, or in his character as an
attorney, this Court will not allow suitors to be exposed to gross fraud and
dishonesty at the hands of one of its officers.

Lord Esher, MR, In re Weare (supra) referred at p. 444 to the dictum of
Cockburn, CJ., and added that the word "strictly" ought to be left out.

In Black (supra) Crompton, J (3 E & E at p. 40 and 30 LJ QB at p. 35) cites a
passage from Chitty's Archbold's Practice, 11th Ed. P. 146: "The Court will,
in general, interfere in this summary way, and strike an attorney off the
roll, or otherwise punish him, for gross misconduct not only in cases where
the misconduct has arisen in the course of a suit, or other regular and
ordinary business of an attorney, but where it has arisen in any other matters
so connected with his professional character as to afford a fair presumption
that he was employed in or entrusted with it in consequence of that
character." In that case blake had made fraudulent use of a deed entrusted to
him because of his character of attorney; and Crompton, J went on to say: "In
the present case I cannot say that Blake's fraud was not committed in a matter
connected with his professional character. If he did not act in it as an
attorney, he, at all events, took advantage of his professional position to
deceive."

That is not the position here. Moonesinghe neither acted in his professional
capacity nor did he take advantage of his professional position to deceive.
However, the fact that he was an attorney-at-law did influence Mrs.
Chandratileke, and perhaps others, and lead them to trust him. Moonesinghe was
confidently entrusted with a large sum of money in consequence of being a
member of an honourable profession. There is a duty we owe the public
generally to admit and keep enrolled only those who can be held out to members
of the public as persons who may with safety be trusted to advise them and
undertake their affairs. (See per Phear, CJ, in Re Edgar Edema (supra) at p.
384; Attorney-General v. Ellawala (supra) per Garvin,

353

Dalton and Lyall Grant, JJ at p. 18; per Soertsz, J in Solicitor-General v
Cooke (supra) at p. 207; per Basnayake, CJ in Solicitor-General v. Abdul Cader
(supra) and in Re Fernando (supra).

Moonesinghe has betrayed the confidence reposed in him as a professional man
in a most reprehensible manner. His misconduct has rendered him unfit to be
held out to members of the public as a person qualified to advise them and to
undertake their affairs and in whom they may safety place their confidence. I
would not have admitted him if we were considering the matter of his
admission. He must therefore be removed from the office of attorney-at-law.

In addition to considering the question of good repute from the point of view
of the State, the Court and the administration of justice, and from the point
of view of the public, the matter should also be looked at by us as trustees
of the legal profession. In _Re an Advocate_ (40) Gratiaen, J at p. 560 said:

Our duty must be measured by the rights of litigants who may seek advice from
a professional man admitted or readmitted to the Bar by the sanction of the
Judges of the Supreme Court. It is also measured by the right of the
profession, whose trustees we are, to claim that we should satisfy ourselves
that re-enrolment will not involve some further risk of degradation to the
reputation of the Bar.

Those observations of Gratiaen, J were quoted with approval by Fernando, J
sub. now re Ranasinghe in Re Wilbert (supra) at p. 28.

We have seen that at the time of applying for admission, an applicant is
required to submit certificates from two or more attorneys-at-law of at least
seven years standing that the applicant is of good repute. (Rule 68 (e) of the
Supreme Court Rules 1978). This is in addition to the Court's own inquiry on
the question in terms of Rule 69, reflecting the Court's concern for the
opinion of our professional brethren of good repute and competency. Rules 60
and 61 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law)
Rules of 1988 (Gazette Extraordinary No. 535/7 of 7 December 1988) made by the
Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution provides as follows:

354

60\. An Attorney-at-Law must not conduct himself in any manner which would be
reasonably regarded as disgraceful or dishonourable by Attorney-at-Law of good
repute and competency or which would render him unfit to remain an Attorney-
at-Law or which is inexcusable and such as to be regarded as deplorable by his
fellows in the profession.

61\. An Attorney-at-Law shall not conduct himself in any manner unworthy of an
attorney-at-law.

In this exercise of our powers conferred by Section 42(2) of the Judicature
Act, there is, I think, a duty we own the profession, as Lord Mansfield said
in _Ex Parte Brounsall_ (39) to ensure that it "should stand free from
suspicion". Perhaps the duty is one we owe the fraternity of lawyers on a
wider basis?; although, undoubtedly, what action one country might take in
relation to misconduct committed elsewhere would depend on the circumstances.
_(E.g. see Bunny v. Judges of New Zealand_ (79); Re A Solicitor, Ex parte
Incorporated Law Society"); _Re lles_ (81); _Macauley v Sierra Leone Supreme
Court Judges_ (82). In Re Batuwantudawe (supra) it was held that it was the
duty of the Registrar of the Court to forthwith inform the English Inn to
which the delinquent lawyer belonged of the decision of this Court with regard
to his removal. There is also, more obviously, a duty to ensure that the
members of the profession he may regularly meet are not required to deal with
an unworthy person. In _Re Weare_ (7) Lord Esher, MR, at p. 446 said as
follows:

The Divisional Court, having heard the case, has come to the conclusion that
this solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence of such a disgraceful
kind that he ought to be struck off the rolls. The Court is not bound to
strike him off the rolls unless it considers that the criminal offence of
which he convicted is of such a personally disgraceful character that he ought
not to remain a member of that strictly honourable profession. Now what is the
offence? The offence is being a party to the use of a house belonging to him
as a brothel. Is it or is it not personally disgraceful? Try it in this way.
Ought any respectable solicitor to be called upon to enter into that intimate
intercourse with him which is necessary between two solicitors, even though
they are

355

acting for opposite parties? In my opinion, no other solicitor ought to be
called upon to enter into such relations with a person who has so conducted
himself. I think he has been convicted of a personally disgraceful offence.

In the same case (at p. 447) Lord Justice Lindley said:

The question is, whether a man is a fit and proper person to remain on the
roll of solicitors and practise as such. That is the question. Now, asking
that question, how can we say that a person who acts as this man is proved to
have acted is a fit and proper person to remain on the roll of solicitors?
What respectable solicitor could without loss of self-respect, knowing the
facts, meet him in business? And what right have we to impose upon respectable
solicitors the duty of meeting him in business?

In relation to the charge of deceit, Moonesinghe has been guilty of such
disgraceful conduct that I should have been quite unwilling to admit him to
the legal profession and to impose upon respectable members of our profession
the duty of meeting such a man in business. Having been admitted, he must now
be removed from the honourable profession in which he now has a place.

All is not lost. If I might adopt the words of Schneider, _ACJ in Re
Seneviratne_ (83); I can only hope that this decision will have "the salutary
effect of awakening in" Moonesinghe "a higher sense of honour and duty." As
Lord Esher observed in Re Weare (supra) and followed with approval in
Attorney-General v. Ellawala (supra) at p. 32, "if he continues a career of
honourable life for so long as to convince the Court that there has been a
complete repentance and a determination to persevere in honourable conduct",
he may be considered for readmission. (See _Re Monerasinghe_ (84); _Re W. A.
P. Jayetilleke_ (85) _Re Ranasinghe_ (86); _Re Batuwantudawa_ (63); _Re
Senaratne_ (87); In the matter of an application for the readmission as a
_Proctor_ (88); _Attorney-General v Ellawela_ (89); _Re Wijesinghe_ (64); In
_Re Britto (supra) at p. 533; Re Wickremasinghe_ (90); _Re Salgadoe_ (91); _Re
Arumugam_ (92); _Re Gaston R. de Vaz_ (45) . For the time being he must be
struck off the roll. No sympathetic considerations must stay my hand. I cannot
show a forbearance or practise a generosity of an

356

unacceptable kind. (See per Soertsz, J in Solicitor-General v. Cooke followed
per Ranasinghe, CJ in Re Nadesan; see also per Gratiaen, J in Re an Advocate
(supra)).

For the reasons set out in my judgment, I am of the opinion that the Rule must
be made absolute. I make order that Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe, Attorney-at-
Law, be removed forthwith from the office of attorney-at-law, and direct that
his name be struck out of the Roll of Attorneys-at-Law of the Supreme Court of
Sri Lanka.  
  
_Rule made absolute._
