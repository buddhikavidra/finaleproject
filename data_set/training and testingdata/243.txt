  _Cur. adv. vult._

August 27, 1997  
  
**FERNANDO, J.**  
  
Mr. Chula de Silva on behalf of the plaintiff-petitioner submits that the
learned High. Court Judge erred in refusing the interim injunction because of
this mistaken assumption that the plaintiff-petitioner was seeking to restrain
the defendant from using the trade mark "Lucky Leaf". Mr. de Silva submits
that his case was that while the defendant was entitled to imitate the
registered trade mark "Get up" of the plaintiff, and that such conduct was in
violation of the plaintiff's right under section 117 of the Code of
Interlectual Property Act, and also constituted passing off as well an unfair
competition. The defendant

**147**

does not claim to have had any prior use of that "Get up". The defendant's
right are confined to the registered trade mark "Lucky Leaf".  
  
Court accordingly grants special leave to appeal upon the questions set out in
paragraph 10 of the petition.  
  
Counsel invite Court to determine this appeal forthwith.  
  
At this stage Mr. Rajapakse concedes that the plaintiff should be granted an
interim injunction as prayed subject to the exception that the defendant is
entitled to use his registered trade mark, as appears in H1.  
  
Court makes order accordingly.  
  
Both counsel state that under the High Court of the Provinces (Special
Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996, every High Court of the Western Province
sitting in Colombo has jurisdiction under that Act.  
  
Since the learned High Court Judge who heard this matter appears to have
expressed a concluded opinion on the merits of the case, it is desirable that
the trial be heard by another Judge,  
  
Court accordingly direct the senior High Court Judge presiding in Court No. 1,
to hear this case or to nominate another Judge to hear this case.  
  
Registrar will forward a copy of this order to the High Court immediately as
the case is fixed for trial on 4.9.97.  
  
No costs.  
  
**DHEERARATNE, J. - I agree.  
  
GUNAWARDENE, J. - I agree.  
**  
_**The Senior High Court Judge presiding in Court No. 1 directed to hear the
case or nominate another judge to hear the case.**_
