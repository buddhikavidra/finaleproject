**AMERASINGHE, J.

**

Mr. Kadiragamar has brought to our notice that the petitioner has not filed
any written submissions and that there has therefore been a failure on the
part of the petitioner to comply with Rule 35 (b) of the Supreme Court Rules
of 1975. He objects to the hearing of the petitioner on that ground.

In view of the decisions of this Court in S.C. Appeal No. 20/ 82 - D.C.
Colombo B-505 S.C. Minutes of 17.1.1983 and S.C. Appeal No. 53/87, S.C.
Special leave to appeal 171/86 - C.A. 337/ 79 - 21698/P.D.C. Kegalle, S.C.
Minutes of 26.05.1988, 1 uphold the objection.

Further, Counsel for the appellant brought to our notice that since the
petitioner has ceased to exist this Court is precluded in terms of Article 134
of the Constitution from proceeding with this matter.

For these reasons the appeal is dismissed without costs.

**

DHEERARATNE, J. -** I agree.

**GOONEWARDENE, J. -** I agree.

_**Appeal dismissed.**
