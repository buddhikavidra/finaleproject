_Cur. adv. vult._

27th October, 1997  
  
**G. P. S. DE SILVA, CJ  
**  
The charges preferred against the appellant in the Magistrate's Court were as
follows:  
  
Criminal Breach of Trust of a sum of Rs. 11,065/65 whilst being the Manager of
the Kandyan Art Association during the period  
1.4.76 to 31.12.76, an offence punishable under section 392 of the Penal Code.  
  
At the time and place aforesaid, failed to pay the telephone bills for May,
June and July amounting to a sum of Rs. 663/95 and made a false entry in
respect of the payment, an offence punishable under section 467 of the Penal
Code.  
  
After trial, the appellant was acquitted on charge No. (2); on charge No. (1)
he was convicted of having committed criminal breach of trust of a sum of only
Rs. 1,063/95. The principal submission advanced on behalf of the appellant was
that the Magistrate "altered" charge No. (1) which alleged criminal breach of
trust of a sum of Rs. 11,065/65, inasmuch as he convicted the appellant of
criminal breach of trust of only Rs. 1,063/95; that the Magistrate having
"altered" the charge in his judgment failed to comply with the mandatory
provisions of section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act; such failure,
it was contended, vitiated the conviction.  
  
On an examination of the evidence at the conclusion of the trial, the
Magistrate found that the appellant has committed criminal breach of trust of
a lesser sum of money than the amount stated in the charge. The penal section
under which he was convicted was the same as the section alleged in the
charge; all other particulars such as the

**80**

time and place of the offence were the same, except that the quantum of money
in respect of which the offence was committed was less than what was stated in
the charge. On a consideration of these facts, I am of the view that the
Magistrate did not "alter" the charge within the meaning of section 167 (1) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The appellant was convicted of the same
charge, the only difference being that the offence was committed in respect of
a lesser sum of money than what was set out in the charge.  
  
In this connection it is not without significance that section 178 (1) of the
code would have permitted the Magistrate to have convicted the appellant of an
offence under section 389, (if the facts warranted such conviction) although
he was charged with an offence under section 392 of the Penal Code.
Illustration (a) to section 178 of the Code makes this position very clear.
But in the instant case even the penal section remained unaltered. I
accordingly hold that there was no "alteration" of the charge within the
meaning of the section 167 of the code.  
  
For these reasons the conviction and sentence are affirmed and the appeal is
dismissed.  
  
**PERERA, J. - I agree.  
  
BANDARANAYAKE, J. - I agree.  
  
_  Appeal dismissed._**
