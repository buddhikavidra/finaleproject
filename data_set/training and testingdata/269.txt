"The powers of a Liquidator under the Finance Act are restricted to those

 Per Wijetunga, J.

  
"To clothe the liquidator with a status in excess of the powers conferred on
him by section 20 of the Finance Act would do violence to those provisions. If
there is a lacuna in the law, it is the legislature that must take remedial
action".

May 29, 1997.  


**FERNANDO, J.** (Dissenting)



The question of law for determination by this bench of five Judges is whether
an employee of the River Valleys Development Board ("RVDB"), a public
corporation, was entitled to make and maintain an application under section
31B(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act ("IDA"), for relief or redress in
respect of the termination of his services by the RVDB and benefits due
thereupon, against the persons appointed as liquidators of the RVDB upon its
dissolution. That section provides:



31B(1) A workman or a trade union on behalf of a workman who is a member of
that union, may make an application in writing to a labour tribunal for relief
or redress in respect of any of the following matters:



(a) the termination of his services by his employer;



(b) the question whether any gratuity or other benefits are due to him from
his employer on termination of his services and the amount of such gratuity
and the nature and extent of any such benefits;



(c) such other matters relating to the terms of employment, or the conditions
of labour, of a workman as may be prescribed.



The RVDB was dissolved, and the 1st respondent-respondent appellant firm
(which I will refer to as "the Appellant") were appointed liquidators under
the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971\. The relevant provisions of that Act are:



19\. Where the appropriate Minister considers that the activities of a public
corporation should be terminated, the Minister may, under the authority of a
resolution passed by Parliament -



(a) dissolve the corporation; and



(b) appoint one or more persons to be the liquidator or liquidators of the
corporation.

20\. The liquidator of a public corporation appointed under section 19 shall,
subject to the directions of the appropriate Minister, have power to -



(a) decide any questions of priority which arise between the creditors;

**239**



(b) compromise any claim by or against the corporation with the sanction of
the Minister previously obtained;



(c) take possession of the books, documents and assets of the corporation;



(d) sell the property of the corporation with the previous sanction of the
Minister; and



(e) arrange for the distribution of the assets of the corporation in a manner
set out in a scheme of distribution approved by the Minister.



21(1) In the liquidation of a public corporation, the funds of the corporation
shall be applied first to the cost of liquidation and then to

the discharge of the liabilities of the corporation.



(2) When the liquidation of a public corporation has been closed, a notice of
liquidation shall be published in the Gazette and no action in respect of any
claim against the corporation shall be maintainable, unless it is commenced
within two years from the date of the publication of such notice in the
Gazette.



(3) Any surplus remaining after the application of funds to the purposes
specified in subsection (1) and the payment of any claim for which an action
has been instituted under subsection (2) shall be vested in the Secretary to
the Treasury.



The facts are not in dispute, except as to the exact date of dissolution. The
RVDB had employed the applicant-appellant respondent ("the applicant') from
1968. By a notice dated 26.2.90 the RVDB terminated his services with effect
from 31.3.90. On 30.9.90 the applicant filed an application in the Labour
Tribunal naming the appellant and the RVDB as respondents. The appellant filed
answer on 16.11.90 averring that, pursuant to a resolution in

**240**



Parliament, by notice published in the Government Gazette of 4.5.90, the
Minister acting in terms of section 19 of the Finance Act, No. 38 of 1971, had
dissolved the RVDB, and appointed the appellant to be the liquidator of the
RVDB.



The Labour Tribunal took up for consideration the preliminary objection that
the application could not be maintained: as against the RVDB, because it was
not in existence; and as against the appellant, because - so it was argued -
the Appellant was never the employer of the applicant, had not been concerned
in the termination of his services, did not carry on the business of the RVDB,
and was not its successor. The Tribunal upheld the objection and dismissed the
application, but on appeal the High Court held that the application was
maintainable. There were other appeals in which the same question arose, and
the High Court order notes that the parties agreed that the order would be
binding in 97 connected cases as well; accordingly, the order of this Court
will apply to those cases. The appellant now appeals to this Court, having
obtained leave to appeal from n the High Court.



At the commencement of the hearing, Mr. P. Nagendran, PC, for the appellant
produced, without objection, the Hansard of 23.3.90, which showed that a
resolution had been passed by Parliament authorising the Minister to dissolve
the RVDB, and the Gazette of 4.5.90, which contained the Minister's
notification dated 15.4.90 to the general public that the appellant had been
appointed liquidator with effect from 1.4.90. However, the document embodying
the Minister's opinion that the activities of the RVDB should be terminated,
as well as his decision to dissolve it, was not produced at any stage in the
Labour Tribunal, in the High Court, or in this Court. Mr. Nagendran also moved
to produce a letter dated 28.3.90 by which, he said, the Secretary to the
Ministry had informed the appellant that the RVDB was being dissolved with
effect from 31.3.90. There was neither a motion (with prior notice to the
applicant) to produce that letter, nor a supporting affidavit to establish its
authenticity. No explanation was offered for the failure to produce the
Minister's order of dissolution. That letter could not be regarded as direct
evidence of a valid dissolution or of its effective date. Quite obviously,
that letter was one which could easily have been produced, had minimum
diligence been exercised, in the



**241**



Labour Tribunal. The appellant thus failed to satisfy all three preconditions
for permitting new evidence in appeal (see Ratwatte v. Bandara," and so we did
not allow that letter to be produced. It is indeed regrettable that the
preliminary objection had been taken and pursued without furnishing necessary
supporting material even six years later at the stage of the second appeal.



However, because the parties had throughout proceeded as if there had been a
valid dissolution, this appeal will be determined on that basis. As for the
date of dissolution, we will assume that it was 31.03.90 because Mr. Desmond
Fernando, PC, who appeared for the applicant, agreed that this appeal be
decided upon that assumption.



The question for our determination involves two matters. Upon the dissolution
of the RVDB and the appointment of the liquidator, did the liabilities of the
RVDB (in respect of the termination of the applicant and the benefits due to
him on termination) vest in or devolve upon the appellant? If so, was the
applicant entitled to make and maintain an application under section 31 B(1)
against the appellant in respect of those liabilities?



# VESTING OF LIABILITIES IN LIQUIDATOR



Mr. Nagendran contended that a liquidator appointed under the Finance Act is
in a different position to one appointed under the Companies Act; that the
only powers of the former are those set out in section 20 of the -Finance Act;
that Act provides neither for ;the vesting of the liabilities of the dissolved
corporation in the liquidator, nor for the liquidator to bring or defend
actions; and that the claims which the liquidator may compromise, under
section 20(b), do not include claims made in a Labour Tribunal.



In regard to the Companies Act, Mr. Nagendran submitted that it provides for
the corporate existence of the company under liquidation to continue until the
liquidation is completed, and to cease only upon a court order being made
thereafter; that it specifies numerous powers which the liquidator may
exercise during the liquidation; and that many of these are normally functions
of the Board of Directors, and even include the carrying on of the business

**242**



of the company. However, under the Finance Act corporate existence ceases
before the liquidation commences, and the liquidator cannot carry on the
business of the corporation. I agree that clearly there are significant
differences between the two liquidation procedures, and I think that this
means that no relevant inference can be drawn from a comparison. Indeed, I
must stress that if the scheme of the Companies Act is that corporate
existence continues during liquidation, it would have been quite
inappropriate, and perhaps impossible, for the company's rights and
liabilities to be vested in the liquidator. But from that certainly does not
follow that the rights and liabilities of a dissolved corporation do not vest
in a liquidator appointed under the Finance Act: on the contrary, since that
Act provides a very different scheme whereby corporate existence ceases, it
seems desirable, if not essential, that the corporation's rights and
liabilities must thereupon vest in someone - and, arguably, who better than
the liquidator? However, I do not wish to rest my decision upon such an
inference. Nor do I think that the failure of the Legislature, to reproduce in
the Finance Act all the powers which the Companies Act confers upon
liquidators, leads to the conclusion that a liquidator's powers under the
former are restricted to those expressly mentioned in section 20, because that
is a matter which must be determined upon an interpretation of that section
taken in its context.



Turning then to section 20, I find that Mr. Nagendran's contention has three
limbs: first, it is only from that section that a liquidator's powers can be
ascertained; second, those powers are. restricted to what is expressly
specified, and no other powers may be implied; and third, even what is
expressly specified must be narrowly construed - thus "any claim", according
to him, excluded a claim made in a Labour Tribunal, and included only a
pending claim.



Section 20 cannot be interpreted in isolation; it must be read with sections
19 and 21, in the context of the scheme of dissolution contemplated by the
Act. What is that scheme? There is a corporation in existence, with a
business, assets, rights and liabilities; it is dissolved; its affairs must
necessarily be wound up (and that is a process which involves the recovery and
realisation of its assets, and the discharge of its liabilities, with the
object of paying any surplus to

**243**



its ultimate owner); someone - and that is a liquidator - is needed to do all
that, and he must have the necessary rights, powers, duties, and functions;
and upon completion of the liquidation, he must pay the surplus to the
Secretary to the Treasury. There are two additional features. The first is
that section 20 provides for a measure of control and guidance: not only is
the Minister empowered to give directions as to the exercise of the powers set
out in section 20, but certain transactions require his specific sanction. The
second is that the termination of the liquidation is in two stages: even after
a "notice of liquidation" is published (section 21(2)), actions may be filed,
in respect of claims against the corporation (e.g. claims which the liquidator
had repudiated, or claims which had not previously been made because they had
not yet matured).



In that scheme, a restrictive interpretation is not at all justified,
particularly one which would impede a fair, orderly and expeditious winding
up. Mr. Nagendran asks us to hold that, under section 20, the liquidator has
no power to bring or defend actions, or to defend or compromise a claim made
in a Labour Tribunal, whether before or after dissolution. But section 21(2)
permits a claimant to file an action even after the "notice of liquidation",
and Mr. Nagendran conceded that it was open to an employee to institute an
action at that stage, although, he said, there would be the difficulty that by
that time the assets of the corporation would already have been distributed. I
cannot agree with Mr. Nagendran that "action" must be narrowly interpreted to
mean a civil action instituted in terms of the Civil Procedure Code. Even the
definition of "action" in that Code is "a proceeding for the prevention or
redress of a wrong", and would include an application, for relief or redress,
to a Labour Tribunal. Further, the words "against the corporation" qualify
"claim", and not "action", and so all such actions must be filed against the
liquidator, and not against the dissolved corporation, since it is no longer
in existence. To interpret section 20 to mean that a liquidator cannot
**defend** an action would be to make nonsense of section 21(2) the
consequence would be that a liquidator faced with an action in terms of
section 21(2) must let judgment go against him by default. In the absence of
compelling language, I am not prepared to attribute to the Legislature an
intention that a liquidator can compromise an exaggerated claim, but cannot
repudiate a false claim and fight it in  


**244**



court. If he can defend an action under section 21(2), he can do so under
sections 19 and 20. Likewise it is unrealistic to contend that section 20 does
not allow a liquidator to **bring** an action. If, for instance, a liquidator
in the exercise of his power to take possession of assets, demanded the
payment of a sum of Rs. 100 million which the corporation had placed on
deposit with a bank, and the bank refused, could it possibly be suggested that
it was the intention of the Legislature that the liquidator could not bring an
action for recovery? If that was the case, how could he discharge his
obligation to wind up the affairs of the corporation, and pay the owner the
surplus?  


I hold that the express power and duty to collect assets and to discharge
liabilities necessarily implies the power and the duty to bring and defend
actions in relation to his functions. And even if section 20 had not been
enacted, the mere fact of being the liquidator was probably sufficient to
imply that power and duty, unless expressly excluded. But that does not mean
that section 20 is superfluous, for its purpose is obvious: to impose
restrictions in relation to some of liquidator's powers and duties. Thus while
he has himself the discretion to repudiate a claim or to defend an action, yet
to compromise a claim he needs the sanction of the Minister; and while he may
transfer an asset in the custody of the corporation to its rightful owner, or
recover an asset from the custody of another, if he wishes to sell property,
the price must be approved by the Minister.



In support of his contention that the liability, if any, of the RVDB did not
pass to the appellant, Mr: Nagendran cited three decisions of the Court of
Appeal: De Silva v. Samajavaadi Lanka Kamkaru Samithiya,(2) which was followed
in Mahipala v. State Fertilizer Manufacturing Corporation(3)and Someswaran et
al. v. de Silva.(4) It was also his submission that when an application is
made to a Labour Tribunal any alleged right or liability is inchoate, and that
it is only the determination of the Tribunal which creates rights and
liabilities. While that may be true of industrial arbitration in respect of
claims for better terms and conditions of employment, the position is
different in regard to rights and liabilities consequent upon termination: the
cause of action is complete, and the fact that the Tribunal has a discretion
in regard to relief, or that it is empowered to grant equitable relief, only
means that rights and liabilities are

**245**



contingent. The death of a workman will preclude the grant of reliefs which
are personal in nature (such as reinstatement), but not monetary compensation.
"Liability" includes inchoate, future, unascertained or imperfect obligations,
and these are capable of   devolving upon a successor (see Ramasamy v. BCC
Ltd.,(5) citing Jowitt, Dictionary of English Law, Vol. 2, page 1085).



There are several other decisions of this Court which show that, even before
an adjudication under the IDA, an employer is subject to a "liability", in
respect of the wrongful dismissal of a workman, which can pass to his
successor: Shaw Wallace & Hedges v Palmerston Tea Co.(6) Ceylon Estates Staffs
Union v. Land Reform Commission(7) and De Silva v. Samajavaadi Lanka Kamkaru
Samithiya.(8)



Those decisions establish, beyond doubt, that the employer's liability ceases.
And that is so even if the employer does not cease to exist (as in Ramasamy,
Shaw Wallace & Hedges, and C.E.S.U. v. L.R,C.)



The question whether pending proceedings can be continued against the
successor depends on who that successor is: if he is a person not subject to
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the proceedings come to an end. Thus upon a
vesting order under the Business Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, No. 35 of
1971, the liability vests in the Government (see Ramasamy) which is not
amenable to the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal, by virtue of section 49
of the IDA, and hence the proceedings cannot continue against the Competent
Authority appointed under that Act: de Silva v. Samajavaadi Lanka Kamkaru
Samithiya (which cites Loku Banda v. Competent Authority, G. D. B. U. of N. T
C.(9) and de Mel v Withana.(10)



However proceedings may be continued where the liability devolves upon other
bodies (such as the Land Reform Commission, as in Shaw Wallace & Hedges, or
the Janatha Estates Development Board, as in C.E.S.U. v L.R.C.).



There are two decisions dealing with the National Textile Corporation which
have caused some confusion. The business undertaking of that corporation had
been vested in the Government

**246**



by an order made in 1979 under the Business Undertakings (Acquisition) Act,
and thereafter, in 1980, the corporation was dissolved and a liquidator
appointed under the Finance Act. N.T.C. v. Sri Lanka Nidahas (etc) Sevaka
Sangamaya,(11) was an appeal filed **before** such vesting and dissolution.
Although the Court of Appeal noted that upon the vesting of its business
undertaking the rights and liabilities of the corporation had vested in the
Competent Authority, the Court did not order that he be substituted, although
notice was issued on him; nor was the liquidator substituted. The appeal was,
subject to a variation as to the amount of compensation, dismissed.



In de Silva v Samajavaadi Lanka Kamkaru Samithiya,(2) (Supra) the application
to the Labour Tribunal had been filed before the vesting order. The Court of
Appeal held that the powers of the liquidator are confined to the five
specified in section 20, and did not extend to bringing or defending actions;
that the liquidator does not carry on the business of the corporation, and is
not its successor; and that he could not be added as a party. However, the
Court held that "the inquiry that has commenced can be continued and concluded
by the Tribunal and a just and equitable order (can) be made", and that the
liquidator would be liable in law to pay any amount awarded as back wages,
compensation, or gratuity (citing Wijewardene v. Chandradasa.(12) This view
is, with respect, inconsistent because it assumes that the liability of the
corporation does not pass to the liquidator upon dissolution, at the stage
when the proceedings are pending, but passes subsequently, when the
proceedings are concluded. it also appears to sanction an action being
continued against a non-existent party-respondent. Further, it is not easy to
accept an interpretation which results in a liquidator being unable to resist
a wholly unmeritorious claim although he knows that he would be bound to
satisfy that claim in full later, upon an award made ex party.



The Court of Appeal also refused to grant a writ of prohibition to stay
further proceedings. Against that order the liquidator successfully appealed
to this Court (SC 48/87 SCM 15.7.93). The resulting position was that the
liquidator was not added or substituted as a party, and the Labour Tribunal
proceedings came to an end. The judgment of Kulatunga, J. shows ample
justification for that result.

**247**



The correct position was that in 1979 (i.e. before the dissolution of the
corporation) its business undertaking, including its liabilities, had been
vested in the Government under the Business Undertakings (Acquisition) Act; no
proceedings could be maintained against the Competent Authority appointed
under that Act because of section 49 of the IDA; when the corporation was
later dissolved, in 1980, its liabilities had already vested in the
Government, and could not, and did not, devolve upon the liquidator.
Naturally, the pending proceedings in respect of those liabilities could not
be continued against him. In so far as that decision has any bearing upon a
dissolution without an intervening vesting in the Government or a third party,
it supports the view that the liabilities of the corporation do pass to the
liquidator.



Finally, I must refer to Jayawickrama v. Jinadasa(13), which dealt with an
application pending in the Labour Tribunal when the RVDB was dissolved. The
order of the Tribunal refusing to add the liquidator was reversed by the High
Court, which correctly held that although the liquidator was not an
"employer", he had to be made a party. An appeal to this Court by the
liquidator was dismissed - not on the merits, but for non-compliance with the
Supreme Court Rules.



All those decisions dealt with dissolution while proceedings were pending, in
the Labour Tribunal or in appeal, with the exception of Wijewardene v.
Chandradasa, (Supra) in which the dissolution of the Janawasama Commission
took place **after** all proceedings were concluded. There the Court of Appeal
held that the liquidator succeeded to the assets and liabilities of the
dissolved Commission, and was bound by the final order.



Reference was made at the hearing to analogies from the law relating to
executors and administrators: that property of a deceased vests in his heirs
but leaving an executor or administrator a limited right of dealing with it
for the purpose of administration. The decisions of this Court to which I have
referred indicate that assets, rights and liabilities pass to the liquidator.
For the purpose of this appeal, it is unnecessary to decide whether that is a
vesting which is absolute, or which is subject to some condition or trust, or
which amounts only to the power and the duty to deal with assets, rights

**248**



and liabilities. It is sufficient to say that the appellant, as liquidator,
has the right, the power and the duty to discharge any liabilities of the
dissolved corporation which arose upon the termination of the services of the
applicant effected by the notice dated 26.2.90. Of course, his liability is
not personal, and extends only to the assets of the corporation (see Latiff v
Fernando(14)).



The case now before us differs from the above decisions to the extent that the
dissolution occurred **before** proceedings commenced. But that cannot affect
the legal position that the rights and liabilities of the RVDB did pass to the
appellant. However, Mr. Nagendran submitted that even if rights and
liabilities in a pending proceeding against an employer might devolve on a
liquidator, a Labour Tribunal application cannot be filed against a
liquidator, naming him as the respondent, because the provisions of the IDA
did not permit it.



# MAINTAINABILITY OF SECTION 31B(1) APPLICATION



It was Mr. Nagendran's contention that an application under section 31 B(1)
could only be made against an "employer"; that the applicant's "employer" was
the RVDB; that the appellant was never his "employer", had not been concerned
in the termination of his services, did not carry on the business of the RVDB,
and was not its successor; and that in any event no enforceable order could be
made against the appellant because under section 40 of the IDA it is only an
"employer" who could be punished for non-compliance.



Nandasena v. Carson Cumberbatch & Co. Ltd.(15), Times of Ceylon v. Nidahas
Karmika Samithiya(16) and other decisions were cited, in support of the
proposition that "employer" did not include an employer's successor-in-title;
and it was urged, relying on Arnolda v Gopalan(17), that an application could
not be made against the successor of an employer.



The definition of "employer" admittedly does not include an employer's
successor-in-title. But however narrow that definition may be, one must first
examine section 318(1) to ascertain whether it permits an application to be
made against an "employer's"

**249**



successor; and if it does, it is irrelevant that the definition does not
include such successor. Mr. Nagendran's argument is based mainly on the
references in that subsection to "the termination of his services **by his
employer** " and to "benefits due **from his employer "; **and also on the
fact that Regulations 15 and 31(3) made under the IDA, as well as Form D, when
referring to the respondent to an application, describe him as the "employer".
But regulations and forms cannot circumscribe the provisions of the principal
Act, by adding limitations which the Legislature did not enact.



It is important not to blur the distinction between two distinct matters: the
cause of action and the identity of the respondent. Section 31B(1) confers a
jurisdiction on Labour Tribunals, which is not unlimited. However being a
provision conferring jurisdiction,, there is no reason to interpret it
restrictively, unless the words require a narrow interpretation. In
determining what is the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, three questions arise.
First, **Who can invoke that jurisdiction, or who can make an application?**
The answer is clear, "it can be invoked only by or on behalf of a workman".
Second, **To what subject-matter does that jurisdiction extend?** Once again
the answer is not in dispute, "only in respect of the termination of services
of a workman and/or terminal benefits thereupon". The third, and distinct,
question is, **Who is subject to that jurisdiction, or against whom can such
an application be made?** Section 31 B(1) is silent as to the proper
respondent. Mr. Nagendran would have us answer that question by adding the
words - words of limitation: "against his employer". But the language of the
subsection suggests that the Legislature intended a broader construction, for
it gave a workman a right "to apply for relief or redress". Since it does not
restrict that right to relief or redress **against his employer** , it means,
at least prima facie, that relief or redress can be claimed against any
person. Of course, if that leads to any absurd, unreasonable, or unjust
result, it should not be adopted. It may be argued, for instance, that this
would allow a total stranger to be sued. But that is possible in any kind of
litigation. Here the Tribunal will ensure that no injustice will result, by
holding either that the workman who has invoked the jurisdiction has no cause
of action against a stranger, or that its jurisdiction extends only to a
person who is liable to give "relief or redress" to the workman. The decisions
of this Court, which I  


**250**



have discussed, establish that although upon dissolution an employer-
corporation may cease to be liable, its liability passes to the liquidator.
Whatever might be the basis on which a Tribunal will dismiss an application
against a total stranger, a liquidator is by no means a stranger, for he is
legally bound to discharge the liability of the dissolved corporation. A
workman is therefore entitled to claim relief or redress from him. I hold that
section 318(1) entitles a workman to make and maintain an application for
relief or redress against the liquidator of the dissolved corporation which
was his employer.



Cases such as Nandasena v. Carson Cumberbatch & Co. Ltd. (Supra) and Shaw
Wallace & Hedges v Palmerston Tea Co., (Supra) dealt with situations to which
an agent of the employer was sought to be made liable, and any observations to
the effect that the employer alone was liable were in the context of that
question. Indeed, the latter case is almost conclusive, for having held that
the agent was not liable, this Court went on to hold that the employer too had
ceased to be liable because its liability had vested in the Land Reform
Commission (cf. also C.E.S.U. v. L.R.C.). Had the employer been a corporation
in respect of which a liquidator had been appointed, the conclusion would have
been that the liability had passed to him.



In Arnolda v. Gopalan (Supra) it was held that a workman was not entitled to
make an application against the widow of his deceased employer, because the
IDA "does not impose any liability on the executor, personal representative,
or the executor de son tort of a deceased person for his debts and
liabilities". With respect, the question for decision was not whether **the
Act** imposes such a liability; but whether in :law the liability of the
deceased had passed to the widow, and, if so, whether the IDA permitted the
workman to claim relief or redress against the widow. Had the widow been sued
only qua widow, I would have agreed that she was not liable - because that was
not sufficient to show that the liability of the deceased had passed to her.
However, the judgment refers to two significant matters: the impugned
settlement had been reached on behalf of the estate of the deceased, and the
widow had registered the deceased's business in her own name and had
thereafter herself

**251**



employed the workman for a few days. Although it was said (at p. 157) that the
Tribunal had **adjudicated** on the workman's claim, the judgment shows that
it had been settled (p. 154) - so that the facts relevant to the question
whether the widow was the employer, either in her own right or by succession,
were not placed before the Tribunal for adjudication. There was thus no patent
want of jurisdiction. Hence the consent order of the Tribunal, never
challenged in appeal, ought not to have been reviewed in a revision
application arising from proceedings for enforcement. I have already set out
my reasons for holding that the IDA permits an application to be filed against
the person to whom the liability of the employer has passed. For these
reasons, with respect, I am of the view that Arnolda v. Gopalan was wrongly
decided.



Mr. Nagendran referred to section 40(1) (q) of the IDA which only penalises a
person who, "being an employer", fails to comply with the order of a Labour
Tribunal. He submitted that an award made against the appellant, the
liquidator, would not be enforceable because he was not an "employer".
Therefore, he argued, an application could not have been made against him. The
fact that an order made by a court or tribunal is not enforceable does not
mean that it has no jurisdiction to make it. Thus in Attorney-General v.
Sabaratnam(18), a declaratory decree against the Crown was affirmed in appeal,
although the Courts were powerless to enforce it, because:



"... Courts of justice have always assumed, so far without disillusionment,
that their declaratory decrees against the Crown would be respected."



And one must not assume that a Labour Tribunal award, to use the words of
Gratiaen, J, in that case. "would be insolently ignored" by a liquidator
performing statutory functions under the directions of the Minister.



It seems to me, however, that an award is enforceable by action. Section 44B
of the IDA provides for the Commissioner of Labour (or a trade union) to
institute a suit "for the recovery of sums due under the] Act from any
employer to any workman in a court of competent jurisdiction.". Of course. I
appreciate that this refers only to an

**252**



"employer", and does not deal with the successor to an employer, but it
confirms the principle that an award is enforceable by civil suit. It is not
this provision which creates the cause of action; on the contrary, it
presupposes that the workman does have a cause of action enforceable in a
civil court; and enacts that, without prejudice to the workman's own right to
institute such an action, the Commissioner too may do so. Section 448 thus
recognizes the principle that upon failure to comply with a Labour Tribunal
award, the workman has a civil cause of action on an award. And if the
Tribunal has- as I hold it has - jurisdiction to entertain an application
against the employer's successor, its award will be similarly enforceable by
civil suit.



It is thus unnecessary to deal with the alleged lack of criminal sanctions. I
must observe, however, that section 48 contains a definition of "employer"
which prevails "unless the context otherwise requires"; and it may well be
that, in a context in which the real employer has ceased to exist, "employer"
in section 40(1) (q) must be interpreted as including the person who has
succeeded to the employer's rights and liabilities.



Let me reiterate in conclusion that Mr. Nagendran's contention that the
present application is not maintainable at this stage, if correct, leads to
the result that a future action (in respect of the very same claim) can be
maintained if instituted within two years from the date of publication of the
notice under section 21(2).



# ORDER



For these reasons I hold that the applicant was entitled to institute and
maintain an application under section 318(1) against the appellant, who
continues to be liable to discharge the liabilities of the RVDB. The appeal is
dismissed, the order of the High Court is affirmed, and the Labour Tribunal is
directed to inquire into the application on its merits. The applicant will be
entitled to costs in a sum of Rs. 15,000 payable by the appellant.



**GUNAWARDENA, J,** \- I agree.



Appeal dismissed.



**253**



**WIJETUNGA, J.**

I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of my brother
Fernando. I regret very much that I am unable to agree with him.



Since the facts to this appeal have been set out by him in his judgment, I do
not propose to repeat them except where necessary.



As formulated by him, "the question for our determination involves two
matters. Upon the dissolution of the RVDB and the appointment of the
liquidator, did the liabilities of the RVDB (in respect of the termination of
the applicant and the benefits due to him on termination) vest in or devolve
upon the appellant? I so was, the applicant entitled to make and maintain an
application under section 31B(1) against the appellant in respect of those
liabilities?"



It was the contention of learned President's Counsel for the appellant that a
liquidator appointed under the Finance Act is in a different position to one
appointed under the Companies Act. Fernando, J. agrees that clearly there are
significant differences between the two liquidation procedures but states that
this means that no relevant inference can be drawn from a comparison. However,
I think it would be useful to set out the provisions of law applicable to a
liquidation procedures but states that this means that no relevant inference
can be drawn from a comparison. However, I think it would be useful to set out
the provisions of law applicable to a liquidator under the Companies Act, No.
17 of 1982, at least for purposes of easy reference. The provisions of
sections 19 , 20 and 21 of the Finance Act, No.38 of 1971, have been
reproduced in the judgment of Fernando, J.



The relevant provisions of the Companies Act are:



S. 277 (1) The liquidator in a winding up by the court shall have power with
the sanction, either of the court or of the committee of inspection -



(a)     to bring or defend any action or other legal proceeding in the name
and on behalf of the company;

**254**



(b)     to carry on the business of the company, so far as may be necessary
for the beneficial winding up of such company;



(c)     to appoint an attorney-at-law to assist him in the performance of his
duties:



Provided that where the liquidator is an attorney-at-law he shall not appoint
his partner unless the latter aggress to act without remuneration;



(d)     to pay any classes of creditors in full;



(e)     to make any compromise or arrangement with creditors or persons
claiming to be creditors, or having or alleging themselves to have any claim,
present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in
damages against the company, or whereby the company may be rendered liable;



(f)       to compromise all calls and liabilities to calls, debts, and
liabilities capable of resulting in debts and all claims, present or future,
certain or contingent, ascertained or sounding only in damages, sub missing or
alleged to subsist between the company and a contributory or other debtor or
person apprehending liability to the company, and all question in any way
relating to or affecting the assets or the winding up of the company, on such
terms as may be agreed and take any security for the discharge of any such
call, debt, liability or claim, and give a complete discharge in respect
thereof.



(2) The liquidator in a winding up by the court shall have power-



(a)     to sell the movable and immovable property and things in action of the
company by public auction or private contract, with power to transfer the
whole thereof any person or company, or to sell the same in parcels;  


(b)     to do all acts and to execute, in the name and on behalf of the
company, all deeds, receipts, and other documents, and for that purpose to
use, when necessary, the company's seal;  


(c)     to prove, rank and claim in the bankruptcy, insolvency, or
sequestration of any contributory , for any balance against his



**255**



     estate, and to receive dividends in the bankruptcy, insolvency or sequestration in respect of that balance, as a separate debt due from the bankrupt or insolvent, and retable with the other separate creditors;  


(d)     to draw, accept, make and endorse any bill of exchange or promissory
note in the name and on behalf of the company, with the same effect with
respect tot the liability of the company as if the bill or note had been
drawn, accepted, made, or endorsed by or on behalf of the company in the
course of its business.  


(e)     To raise on the security of the assets of the company any money
requisite ;



(f)       to take out in his official name letters of administration to any
deceased contributory, and to do in his official name nay other act necessary
for obtaining payment of nay money due from a contributory or his estate which
cannot be conveniently done in the make of the company, and in all such cases
the money due shall, for the purpose of enabling the liquidator to take out
the letters of administration or recover the money, be deemed to be due to the
liquidator himself:



Provided that nothing herein empowered shall be deemed to affect the rights,
duties, and privileges of the Public Trustee appointed under the public
Trustee Ordinance;



(g)     to appoint an agent to do any business on behalf of such liquidator ;



(h)     to do all such other things as may be necessary for winding up the
affairs of the company and distributing its assets.



(3) The exercise by the liquidator in a winding up by the court of the powers
conferred by the provisions of this section shall be subject to the control of
the court, and any creditor or contributory may make an application to the
court for the exercise or proposed exercise of any of those powers.



S.333. (1) The liquidator may-

**256**

(a)     in the case of a members' voluntary winding up, with the sanction of
an extraordinary resolution of the company, and, in the case of a creditors
voluntary winding up, with the sanction of either the court or the committee
of inspection or (if there is not such committee) a meeting of creditors,
exercise nay of the powers specified in the provisions of paragraphs (d), (e)
and (f) of subsection (1) of section 277 to a liquidator in a winding up by
the court;  


(b)     without sanction, exercise any power other than those referred to in
paragraph (a) by this Act given to the liquidator in a winding up by the
court;  


(c)   exercise the power of the court under the provisions of this Act of
settling a list of contributories, and the list of contributories shall be
prima facie evidence of the liability of the persons named therein to be
contributories;  


(d)     exercise the power of the court of making calls;  


(e)  summon general meetings of the company for the purpose of obtaining the
sanction of the company by special or extraordinary resolution or for any
other purpose he may think fit.



(2) The liquidator shall pay the debts of the company and shall adjust the
rights of the contributories among themselves.



(3) When several liquidators are appointed, any power given by this Act may be
exercised by such one or more of them as may be determined at the time of
their appointment, or, in default of such determination, by nay number not
less than two.



Even on a superficial reading of the respective provisions of the Finance Act
and the Companies Act, the vast disparity between the powers and functions of
liquidators under the two Acts becomes quite evident. In my view, the powers
of a liquidator under the Finance Act are restricted to those expressly
mentioned in section 20, though that section must be read with sections 19 and
21. Fernando, J. holds that the express power and duty to collect assets and
to discharge liabilities necessarily implies the power and the

**257**



duty to bring and defend actions in relation to his functions. I have no
difficulty in broadly agreeing with that proposition. But, that does not
dispose of the matter. In the case before us, even assuming that upon the
dissolution of the RVDB and the appointment of the liquidator, the liabilities
of the RVDB (in respect of the applicant and the benefits due to him on
termination) did vest in or devolve upon the appellant, there is the threshold
question whether the applicant was entitled to make and maintain an
application **under section 31B (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act** against
the appellant in respect of those liabilities.



Fernando, J. states that in determining what the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
is, three questions arise, and provided the answers-



"First, **who can invoke that jurisdictions, or who can make an application?**

_  
_

The answer is clear, "it can be invoked only by or on behalf of a workman .'



Second, **to what subject-matter does that jurisdiction extend?** Once again,
the answer is not in dispute, only in respect of the termination of services
of a workman and/or terminal benefits thereupon.



The third, and distinct question, is **who is subject to that jurisdiction or
against whom can such an application be made?** Section 31B (1)is silent as to
the proper respondent."



It is in regard to his answer to the third question that I am unable to agree
with him.



He goes on to say that "Mr. Nagendran would have us answer that question by
adding the words - words of limitation: against his employer'. But the
language of the subsection suggests that the Legislature intended a broader
construction, for it gave a workman a night to apply for relief or redress.'
Since it does not restrict that right to relief or redress against his
employer,' it means, at least prima facie, that relief or redress can be
claimed against any person. Of course, if that leads to any absurd,
unreasonable, or unjust result, it should not be adopted. It may be argued,
for instance, that this would allow total stranger may be sued. But that is
possible in any kind of litigation. Here the Tribunal will ensure that no
injustice will

**258**



result, by holding either that the workman who has invoked the jurisdiction
has no cause of action against a stranger, or that its jurisdiction extends
only to a person is liable to give relief or redress' to the workman. The
decisions of this Court, which I have discussed, establish that although upon
dissolution and an employer corporation may cease to liable, its liability
passes to the liquidator. Whatever might be the basis on which a Tribunal will
dismiss an application against a total stranger, a liquidator is by no means a
stranger, and is obliged to discharge the liability of the dissolved
corporation. A workman is therefore entitled to claim relief or redress from
him. I therefore hold that section 31B (1) entitles a workman to make and
maintain an application for relief or redress against the liquidator of the
dissolved corporation which was his employer."



I am of the view that the Industrial Disputer Act, when it speaks of relief or
redress', takes cognizance of the employer - workman' relationship based on a
contract of service, which concept is woven into the entire fabric of that
law. It is, therefore, superfluous to specify that such relief or redress
should be claimed against the employer.  




A bench of five judges of the then Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka, in setting
aside a judgment of the then Supreme Court, considered the definition of the
term employer' in section 48 of the Industrial Disputes Act, in Carson Cumber
batch & Co. Ltd. v. Nandasena, (15) under three limbs:



(1)     any person who employs and workman,  


(2)     any person on whose behalf any other person employs any workman,  


(3)     any person who on behalf of any other person employs any workman.



The majority of the Court (with one Judge dissenting) held inter alia that (i)
a labour Tribunal cannot, by making wrong decision as to the identity of the
employer, whether by reason of a mistake of fact or by reason of a mistake of
law, give itself power or jurisdiction to make orders against a person who is
not the particular workman's employer' within the meaning of the Industrial
Disputes Act and (ii) the appellant was not an employer of the workman within
the

**259**



meaning off the definition of the term employer' in section 48 of the
Industrial Disputes Act. The person referred to as a person employing a
workman in each of the three limbs of the definition is intended to refer to a
person who is under contractual obligation to the workman.



Tennakoon, J. said at page 83 that "there are numerous other enactments in
which the term employer' is defined in a manner similar to that employed in
the Industrial Disputes Act...............we must confess that we have found
this excursion into the field of labour legislation unhelpful in trying to
ascertain the meaning of the word employer as used in the Industrial Disputes
Act. A more legitimate and more profitable exercise would be to examine the
Industrial Disputes Act itself for any indication oft eh legislative intent.
We fine considerable evidence within the four corners of the Industrial
Disputes Act to support the view that an employer, whether he be principal or
agent, must have a contract of service with the workman. "He emphatically
stated at page 84 that "the existence of a contract with his employer is the
sine qua non for identifying a workman."



That only the employer could be made a party respondent in a dispute under the
Industrial Disputes Act was once again recognized in Shaw Wallace & Hedges Ltd
v. The Palmerston Tea Co. Ltd.,(6) where Samarakoon, C.J. said at pages 14 and
15 that "We are here concerned with a dispute between an employer and
workman...............The question for decision then is whether the appellant
was an Agent which entered into a contractual obligation with the petitioner
and thereby made itself liable to the petitioner .....................The
appellant was not the employer of the petitioner and therefore has been
wrongly made a party to the reference by the Minister."



In Ceylon Estates Staffs Union v. Land Reform Commissions,(7) where counsel
for the JEDB conceded that the JEDB became liable to employ the workman and
pay him his wages and arrears as from the date when the estate vested in the
board, but disputed the Board's liability to pay the arrears of wages prior to
that date, Sharvananda, C.J. held that by operation of law the JEDB had
succeeded to the rights and liabilities of the Commission in respect of the
workman and that the liability in respect of which the award was made became
the liability of the JEDB and that the JEDB will have to

**260**



give effect to the reliefs ordered by the award. He however made further
observation that the Court has "taken the unusual course of amending the award
to make the JEDB liable."



In De Silva (Liquidator of the national Textile Corporation) v. Samajavadi
Lanka Kamkaru Samitiya,(6) ,the Court of Appeal held inter alia that the
powers of the liquidator are confined to those specified in section 20 of the
Finance Act. The only question for decision by the Supreme Court was whether a
writ of prohibition against the continuation of proceedings by the Labour
Tribunal should be granted; and Kulatunga, J. did set aside that part of the
order of the Court of Appeal which permitted the continuation of proceedings
before the Labour Tribunal. But, in the absence of a cross appeal against the
order quashing the addition of the appellant, the Court declined to accede to
the request of counsel to make order for such addition. It was also held that
the Competent Authority of the Government Owned Business Undertaking of the
N.T.C. cannot be sued before the Labour Tribunal.



In Jayawickrama v. Jinadasa,(13) where the RVDB was dissolved and the
appellant was appointed as its liquidator under section 9 of the Finance Act
No. 38 of 1971, whilst the application made to the Labour Tribunal by the
respondent against the termination of his services by the said Board was
pending, the Labour Tribunal refused to add the appellant as a respondent. But
in appeal the High Court directed the addition of the appellant.



The Supreme Court was unable to hear the case and decide that question as the
appeal had to be dismissed in terms of Rule 40 of the Supreme Court Rules,
1978. This that decision is no more than an opinion of the High Court.



The decision of Fernando, J. in Wickramasighe v. Sri Lanka State Trading
(Consolidated Exports ) Corporation (19) was in a situation where "the
Corporation represented to applicant and to the Tribunal, and induced both to
act on the factual basis that the liabilities of the Company, in respect of
the subject-matter of the Lis had devolved on the Corporation, and invited the
Tribunal to substitute the Corporation."

**261**



The Industrial Disputes Commission (presided over by H.W. Jayawardene. Q.C),
having made a thorough and exhaustive examination of the Industrial Disputes
Act, made specific reference in its report (Ceylon Sessional Papers, 1970) to
the expression employer' as defined in that Act and stated that "in our
opinion this definition is not sufficiently wide since it does not take into
consideration the legal heirs, successors in law, executors and
administrators, and liquidators of a company, any one of whom may be called
upon to answer to a claim made by a workman"- (page 175, paragraph 571).



The commission went on to draft a comprehensive Labour Relations Act to
replace the Industrial Disputes Act and in section 172 thereof (page 395)
included the following definition of employer': "Employer" means any person
who employs, or on whose behalf any other person employees, any workman, and
includes a body of employers (whether such body is a firm, company,
corporation or trade union) and any person, who on behalf of nay other person,
employees any workman; and includes the legal heir, successor in law, executor
or administrator, and liquidator of a company, and in the case of an
unincorporated body, the President or the Secretary of such body, and in the
case of Partnership, the managing partner or manager.'



It is significant that despite a number of decisions of the Appellate Court
pertaining to the question of identity of an employer' under the Industrial
Disputes Act and the specific recommendations of the Commission on Industrial
Disputes aforementioned, the Legislature chose not to amend the existing
definition of employer' in section 48, even when substantial amendments were
made to that Act by the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act, No. 32 of 1990.



In fact, with regard to appeals to the High Court from an order of a Labour
Tribunal, the amending Act provides in section 31 D (4) that "every employer
who appeals to a High Court ................ shall furnish to such labour
tribunal, security in cash" etc. Implicit in that provision is the recognition
of the fact that it is the employer alone who could be sued in proceedings
before that Labour Tribunal.



In the light of what has been stated above, I do not think that the
Legislature interned that a liquidator would be made a party  


**262**



respondent to an application by a workman for  relief or redress before a
Labour Tribunal or that such liquidator would be substituted in place of the
employer'.



On the question of enforceability of an order made by a Labour Tribunal,
section 40(1) (q) would have no application to a liquidator, as he is not the
employer within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act. Fernando, J.
observes that "The fact that an order made by a court or tribunal is not
enforceable does not mean that it has no jurisdiction to make it. "But, of
what use would such an order be to a workman who is seeking relief within the
framework of the Industrial Disputes Act? I would not be content to assume
that such an award made by a Labour Tribunal would not "be insolently ignored
by a liquidator performing statutory functions under the directions of the
Minister." Litigation in this sphere is not without examples to the contrary.
In any event, I would rather ensure that such an order is given effect to,
having recourse where necessary to the penal provisions of the Industrial
Disputes Act, than leave to the good sense' of the liquidator.



Even as regards the provisions of section 44B to which Fernando, J. refers,
such a civil suit also could be instituted only against an employer and, as he
himself points out, does not deal with the successor to an employer. In the
view I have taken, I cannot agree with him that such an award would be
enforceable by civil suit against a liquidator, who is not even the successor
in law of the employer.



On the other hand, from the point of view of a liquidator, what is the
justification for exposing him to liability under the penal provisions
aforesaid, when he was never the employer"? The words "unless the context
otherwise requires" in section 48 do not in my view warrant the inclusion of a
person who is not even a successor in law of the employer, merely for the
reason that "the real employer has ceased to exist. " Such an interpretation
would even inhibit a person from undertaking the functions of a liquidator
under the Finance Act. To clothe the liquidator with a status in excess of the
powers conferred on him by section 20 of the Finance Act would do violence to
those provisions. If there is a lacuna in the law, it is the Legislature that
must take remedial action.



**263**



The foremost question is whether the liquidator is the employer' of the
workman', within the meaning of the Industrial Disputes Act. If the answer to
that question is in the negative, then it would follows that the workman
cannot make the liquidator a party respondent to an application for relief or
redress under the Industrial Disputes Act.



While I do appreciate the desirability of giving the term employer' a wider
definition, (which my brother Fernando seeks to do through interpretation), in
my view, it is essentially a matter for the legislature and not for this
Court.



This brings me to the question whether Arnolda v. Gopalan (Supra) was wrongly
decided. The workman's application was for the period he was employed under
Mr. Bobby Arnolda.' The settlement arrived at between the petitioner (the
widow) and the respondent was on behalf of the estate of the late Mr. Bobby
Arnolda;. Counsel for the respondent argued that "the sum which she (the
petitioner) had consented to pay included the wages due to the respondent for
a few days in September when he was employed under the petitioner.' Thambiah,
J. however, held that the Labour Tribunal had only adjudicated on a claim of
the respondent for wages, gratuity etc., alleged to be due to him during the
period he worked under the late Mr. Bobby Arnolda, and this contention,
therefore, was untenable. There was no finding that the sum which she had
agreed to pay included the wages due for those few days.



Fernando, J. states that "the question for decision was ...... whether in law
the liability of the deceased had passed to the widow, and if so, whether IDA
permitted the workman to claim relief or redress against the widow. Had the
widow been sued only qua widow, I would have agreed that she was not liable-
because that was not sufficient to show that the liability of the deceased had
passed to her."



The judgment in Arnolda's case states at page 157 that "liability under this
statute, therefore, cannot be extended to a widow of a deceased employer, who
is brought before the Labour Tribunal and against whom relief is sought for a
liability incurred by her late husband", indicating thereby that the Tribunal
did not deal with any other claim.



**264**



Except for the mere assertion of counsel for the respondent at the stage of
appeal that "the sum which she (the widow) had consented to pay included the
wages due to the respondent for a few days in September when he was employed
under the petitioner", there is no material whatsoever to show that the widow
had been sued in any capacity other than qua widow. The fact that the
settlement did not take into account the alleged period of service under the
widow is clear as "the petitioner agreed to pay the respondent the sum of
Rupees 2,073/50 cts. On behalf of the estate of the late Mr. Bobby Arnolda".
Furthermore, what the petitioner (the widow), by letter dated 2nd September
1959, had informed the respondent was that "the letter's services had ceased
in view of the death of her husband."



There was thus no need to adjudicate upon the question whether the widow was
the employer in her own right, as the entire basis of the applicant's claim
against her was qua widow.



I cannot, therefore, agree that Arnolda v. Gopalan was wrongly decided.



For the reasons aforesaid, I would allow this appeal, set aside the order of
the High Court, and affirm the order of the Labour Tribunal. The appellant
will be entitled to costs, both here and in the Court below. It is noted that,
as agreed by the parties in the high Court, this order would be binding in the
97 connected cases as well.



**PERERA, J.** \- I agree.



**ANANDACOOMARASWAMY, J.** \- I agree.



 By Majority decision appeal allowed.
