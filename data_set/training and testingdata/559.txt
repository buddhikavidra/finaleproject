DISSANAYAKE, J.  
SC (FR) APPLICATION NO. 338/2003.  
20TH OCTOBER 2005 AND 10TH AND 17TH JANUARY, 2006.

_Fundamental Rights- Appointment of officer to Grade 3 - 1 of the People's
Bank - Promotion of Management Trainees - Change of scheme of recruitment in
an arbitrary manner giving higher appointments to respondent officers -
Article 12(1) of the Constitution._

    The petitioners were recruited as management trainees of the People's Bank in 1990 and 1994 in terms of circular 300/99 under which persons were first appointed management trainees. After probation they were in due course promoted to Grade 3-111,3-11 and 3-1.As against this procedure ,in 2003 the Bank appointed 5th to 51 st respondents to Grade 3-1having altered the scheme in circular 300/99 which enabled direct recruitments on a claim that such appointments were made after probation and an examination. The 5th to 51st respondents were recruited as management trainees only in the year 2000 and were given direct appointments to Grade 3 - 1 in 2003 despite protests by petitioners who were in 2003 in Grade 3-11having complied with circular 300/ 99. The petitioners who protested were not given any information or replies to their communications and the recruitments of 5th to 51st petitioners to Grade 3-1 were done in secrecy. The respondent counsel said that such appointments were made as circular 300/99 was a failure and there resulted a management crisis in the Bank which was averted by the new procedure and appointments directly to Grade 3-1 of the 5th to 51 st respondents.

**HELD:**

1\. There was no evidence of a management crisis in the Bank. In any event the
change of procedure of appointment and the scheme in circular 300/99 to the
prejudice of the petitioners was arbitrary and unjustified though in
principle, the Bank may alter the scheme of recruitment. But this must be done
without violating the rights of petitioners under Article 12(1) of the
Constitution.

2\. The appointments of 5th to 51st respondents to Grade 3-1of the Bank's
Service were invalid.

**SHIRANI BANDARANAYAKE, J.**

The petitioners, who were employed in the 1st respondent Bank as Deputy
Managers in Grade 3 - II of the Staff Grade alleged that their fundamental
rights guaranteed in terms of Articles 12(1)and 14(1)(g) were violated by the
respondents for which this Court granted leave to proceed in terms of Article
12(1) of the Constitution.

    The petitioners' version, in terms of their submissions, is as follows:

    According to the petitioners all of them were eligible for promotion to the post of Manager Grade 3 - I of the 1st respondent Bank in terms of Clauses 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 of Staff Circular No. 300/99 of the 1st respondent Bank (P1).

    The 2nd and 4th to 8th petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the batch of 1990) were employed by the 1st respondent Bank as 'Management Trainees' in October 1990 and the 1st, 3rd and 9th to 12th petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the batch of 1994) were recruited by the respondent Bank in a similar capacity as 'Management Trainees' in March 1994.

    These two batches, according to the petitioners, were selected consequent to a rigorous selection process, including a competitive test from among 1000 applicants in 1990 and out of 800 applicants in 1994. Out of the 1000 applicants, only 30 were selected for the batch of 1990 and 36 for the batch of 1994. Thereafter, upon attaining the requistite qualifications stipulated in StaffCircularNo.300/99(P1) including the period of probation, the 3rd, 4th and 5th petitioners were appointed to Grade3 - II as Deputy Managers of the 1st respondent Bank with effectfrom07.12.1995 and the 12th petitioner on 01.03.1999(P4). The 1st, 2nd and 6th to 11th petitioners ,who had failed to fulfill the  eligibility criteria for such appointment along with the other petitioners, however had obtained the requisite qualifications thereafter and were appointed to Grade 3 - II as Deputy Managers with effect from 03.12.1999 based up on a scheme proposed by the Board of Directors of the 1st respondent Bank for that purpose (P5A, P5B, and P6).

    According to the petitioners, in terms of Clause 3 of Staff Circular No. 300/99, their next promotion was to Grade 3 - I in the rank of Manager. Sub Clauses 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. of the Staff Circular No. 300/99 (P1), refer to the method in which such promotions are to be effected. In terms of those provisions, whilst 30% is allocated for appointments based on seniority, 70% is allocated to be filled on the results of a competitive test in addition to the requirement of attaining the necessary experience. The 1st to 3rd petitioners became qualified at the competitive examination held in February 2000. The 4th to 12th petitioners did not qualify at the examination and were awaiting the conducting of the next competitive examination for such purpose. 

    As submitted by the petitoners, in December 2001, the 1st respondent Bank recruited a further batch of Management Trainees including the 5th to 51st respondents (hereinafter referred to as the batch of 2002). This batch commenced training in February, 2002. The petitioners submitted that there were not able differences in the recruitment of batch of 2002from the previous batch, which comprise the following:

(a) the training period was extended to 3 years;  
(b) the allowance paid had increased substantially;  
(c) no provisions guaranteeing the confirmation of service, upon the
successful completion of training/probation period; and  
(d) no provisions therefore relating to promotions thereafter, even in the
event of being absorbed into the cadre of the 1st respondent.

According to the petitioners, at the time this application was filed, the
Management Trainees of batches of 1990 and 1994 were placed as Deputy Managers
at their respective branches of the 1st respondent Bank. Most of them were
functioning in the capacity of heads of Departments, whilst some were
appointed as Managers. Although there was no specific guarantee that the batch
of 2002 would be employed by the 1st respondent upon the completion of their 3
year's training, which was due in year 2005, it was common understanding that
those who are successful in the batch would be placed in Grade 3 -III as
Assistant Managers in terms of Staff Circular No. 300/99 (P1 ). Moreover, the
petitioners contended that many of the said batch of 2002 were placed directly
under the supervision of most of the petitioners.

    However, contrary to the accepted procedure laid down in Staff Circular No. 300/99(P1), the petitioners were reliably made to understand on 23.06.2003 that, 

(a) there were moves afoot on the part of the 3rd and 4th respondents to
abruptly suspend the training period of the said batch of 2002, based upon a
proposal submitted to the Board;  
(b) the said batch of 2002 were to be placed in positions as Managers of the
1st respondent in Grade 3 - I in preference to the petitioners; and  
(c) although this was contrary to the scheme of promotion (P1) the Board had
in fact approved this scheme.

    Soon after, petitioners had collectively made representations to the 3rd respondent on 23.06.2003 seeking to ascertain the veracity of the above information, the 3rd respondent had informed the petitioners that there had been such a proposal submitted to the Board of Directors. When objection was taken at the said meeting for any move to alter the status of appointments to Grade 3-I, the 3rd respondent had categorically informed them that any such appointment would be made only upon the successful completion of a competitive examination. However ,no details were given regarding the said examination. Thereafter the petitioners addressed a letter dated 30.06.2003 to the 2nd respondent informing him of the aforementioned meeting and seeking his immediate intervention in this matter (P9). According to the petitioners they never received a reply to this letter. Notwithstanding the steps taken by the petitioners, they had learnt that the 1st to 4th respondents had taken steps to appoint the said batch of 2002 to Grade 3 - 1of the 1st respondent Bank with effect from 16.06.2003(P11).

    The petitioners therefore alleged that the said appointments of the 5th to 51st respondents to Grade 3 - I of the,1st respondent Bank are unfair, arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the fundamental right guaranteed to them in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

    The learned President's Counsel for the respondents submitted that the senior management ranks within the 1st respondent Bank consisted 1 of the following positions; viz. General Manager, Deputy General Manager, Assistant General Manager, Grade I - Chief Manager, Gracie II - Senior Manager, Grade 3 - I - Manager, Grade 3 \- II - Deputy Manager and Grade 3 - III \- Assistant Manager.

    According to the learned President's Counsel for the respondents, the 1st respondent Bank was compelled to change its recruitment procedure in 1987 due to extreme pressure the 1st respondent Bank had to face from the trade unions. Therefore in 1987, 1990 and 1994, the 1st respondent Bank had recruited over 100 Management Trainees on the basis that after the period of probation they would be given permanent employment as Grade 3 -III-Assistant Managers. From this group of Trainees, the more competent Assistant Managers, it was expected, would eventually through a process of promotions rise up to the ranks of Grade 3 - II - Deputy Managers, Grade 3 -1- Managers and to higher positions. However, due to the existing scheme of promotion within the Bank, it was found that the said Management Trainees would be able to reach only the next promotional Grade of 3 - I Manager and therefore it was felt that the Bank's line of succession would be greatly endangered if the said scheme of recruitment of Management Trainees was to continue and it was felt that the change of the scheme of recruitment of Management Trainees adopted in 1987 was a mistake and a failure.    Learned President's Counsel for the 1st respondent Bank contended that since the recruitment procedure and the relevant criteria for promoting the said recruits were so ineffective, that the Bank would face a vacuum in its senior management positions within the next few years, the 1st respondent Bank had decided to adopt an entirely new recruitment procedure to recruit its Management Trainees.

    In these circumstances, since the 1st respondent Bank had decided to adopt an entirely new recruitment procedure to recruit its Management Trainees, it was contended that the recruitment procedure adopted for the batch of 2002 has no relationship to Circular No. 300/99 (P1 ), which deals with promotions and recruitments/appointments. 

    It is not disputed that the petitioners as well as the 5th to 51st respondents were recruited to the 1st respondent Bank as 'Management Trainees'. It is also not disputed that, at the time the 5thto 51st respondents joined the Bank, the petitioners were functioning in the grade of Class 3- III of the 1st respondent Bank. The 5th to 51st respondents were recruited in 2002 in terms of the applications called by advertisement marked 17A. By that advertisement, applications were called for Management Trainees. It is thus clear that the petitioners as well as the 5th to 51st respondents had joined the 1st respondent Bank as Management Trainees at different times. At the time the 5th to 51 st respondents were recruited as Management Trainees, they had entered into an agreement with the 1st respondent Bank for them to be trained in banking practices for a period of three years. The 5th to 51st respondents were recruited in 2002 and therefore their training was to be completed only in 2005. At the time the impugned promotions were given to the 5th to 51 st respondents, admittedly they were probationary Management Trainees and had not been appointed to Grade 3 - III.

    As referred to earlier, the petitioners as well as the 5th to 51st respondents were all recruited to the 1st respondent Bank on the same basis as Management Trainees. After the initial recruitment, there cannot be further recruitments to the service as thereafter it would only be promotions and therefore, I am not inclined to accept the version given by the learned President's Counsel that the promotions in question are only recruitments. Moreover, the 1st respondent Bank having stated that the 5th to 51st respondents were not promoted, but recruited for a second time on a different basis has further contended that 'although the 5th to 51st respondents were contracted as Management Trainees for a training period of three years due to the above reasons, the Bank decided to change the recruitment conditions and decided to offer the 5th to 51st respondents a new contract of service by which they were to be placed in Grade 3 - I after one year of probation and after successfully passing the relevant examinations.'

    This clearly indicates that although the petitioners as well as the 5th to 51st respondents were recruited by the 1st respondent Bank on the same basis as Management Trainees, the 1st respondent Bank had thereafter taken steps to alter the position of the newly recruited batch of Management Trainees (5th to 51st respondents) from that of Management Trainees to Manager Grade 3 - I. It is to be borne in mind that, at the time such appointments were made, the batch of 2002, had not completed their initial probationary period, and therefore ths;1tbatch was never promoted either to Grade 3 - III or Grade 3 - II. Thus the steps taken by the 1st respondent Bank clearly indicates that the petitioners were treated unfairly and unreasonably without giving due consideration to the provisions of Circular No. 300/99 (P1), which made the petitioners to allege that their fundamental rights were violated by the 1st respondent Bank. 

    Article 12(1) of the Constitution deals with the right to equality and reads as follows: 

    "All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.&quot ; 

    The right to equality means equal protection from both legislative and executive actions, which would be treated as arbitrary and discriminatory. The guarantee of equality stipulated in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution therefore is directed against actions which are arbitrary and/ or discriminatory. Further the concept of 'equal protection of the law' denotes equal treatment under similar circumstances. This concept clearly postulates that equals should be treated equally and that among such equals the law should be equal and equally administered. Referring to the right to equality, Subba Rao, J. in State of U. P. v Deoman'1)stated that,

    "All persons are equal before the law is fundamental of every civilized Constitution. Equality before law is a negative concept; equal protection of laws is a positive one. The former declares that every one is equal before law, that no one can claim special privileges and that all classes are equally subjected to the ordinary law of the land; the latter postulates an equal protection of all alike in the same situation and under like circumstances. No discrimination can be made either in the privileges conferred or in the liabilities imposed."

    The concepts of negation of arbitrariness and unreasonableness are embodied in the right to equality as it has been decided that any action or law which is arbtirary or unreasonable violates equality (International Airport Authority's case (2),Air India v Nargesh Meerza (3)and Basantibai v State of Maharashtra(4). In Maneka Gandhi v Union of India (S)referring to the principle of reasonableness it was stated that, "The principle of reasonableness, . . . legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness. . . ."

Further in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib(6)after considering the concept of
reasonableness and its applicability, it was held that,

    "the concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervade the entire constitutional scheme and is a golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of the Constitution."

    The petitioners' allegation is that, the 1st respondent Bank, made appointments to Grade 3 - I from amongst the 5th to 51st respondents, who had joined the 1st respondentBankin2002as Management Trainees, with effect from 16.06.2003 (P11), whilst the petitioners employed in the capacity of Deputy Managers in Grade 3 \- II of the Staff Grade of the 1st respondent Bank and who had initially joined as Management Trainees in 1990 and 1994, were not so promoted and the said decision of the 1st respondent Bank not to promote the petitioners prior to granting promotions to 5th to 51st respondents is unreasonable.

    It is not disputed that there cannot be direct appointments made to the rank of Manager Grade 3 - I of the 1st respondent Bank and there could be only promotions to that position. It is also not disputed that the said promotions are governed by the Staff Circular No. 300/99(P1). If the 1st respondent Bank thought it fit to have direct appointments to be made to Grade 3-1, then the 1st respondent Bank should have first amended the scheme of promotions contained in Circular No. 300/99 (P1 ) taking into consideration the requirements of the Bank.

    Although the 1st to 4th respondents refer to a 'management crisis' and due to such situation that they had decided to promote 5th to 51st respondents to the rank of ManagerGrade3 - I overlooking the petitioners, the respondent shave not established there was in fact such a management crisis in the Bank, which necessited them to promote 5th to 51st respondents overlooking the petitioners. It is also to be borne in mind that, the 1st to 4th respondents had referred to a situation, where there 'would be a management crisis' only in their objections, however, without any supporting material. The petitioners on the other hand by their document marked P16 had clearly demonstrated the fact that there is no such 'management crisis' as presented by the 1st to 4th respondents and even in the event that there is the strongest likelihood of such kind of a crisis, then the simplest solution for such crisis would be to facilitate the promotional prospects of the petitioners and other Management Trainees recruited in 1990 and 1994, in terms of Staff Circular No. 300/99 (P1), but not the decision to promote the 5th to 51st respondents overlooking the petitioners. There was no evidence forthcoming from the 1st respondent Bank as to the action they had taken to get over any such 'management crisis' they were concerned of and even the document titled 'Need to change the policy on  recruiting Management Trainees to People's Bank' (R1) is undated and no material was placed before this Court to show that action had been taken to consider the said document, as there appears to be no decision taken on this document. 

    It is to be borne in mind that at the time a decision was taken to deviate from the scheme of promotions, the 1st to 4th respondents had not given any notice of such change and therefore the petitioners were not aware of the basis of the promotions granted to the 5th to 51st respondents.

    Considering the aforementioned circumstances it is evident that there was no scheme of recruitment to the post of Manager Grade 3 -I directly other than through the scheme and process provided for in Staff Circular No. 300/99(P1). It is not disputed that the petitioners belong to the group of batches of 1990and 1994whereas the 5th to 51st respondents belong to the batch of 2002. The petitioners therefore were clearly senior to the 5th to 51st respondents. Furthermore, it is common ground that the petitioners as well as the 5th to 51st respondents had joined the 1st respondent Bank as Management Trainees. More importantly at the time the promotions to the rank of ManagerGrade3-I were made, the petitioners were functioning as Deputy Manager Grade 3 - \I and the 5th to 51st respondents were still functioning as Management Trainees. Accordingly, it is obvious that, by the decision of the 1st respondent Bank to promote the 5th to 51st respondents to Grade 3 -lover looking the petitioners, they had acted unfairly, unreasonably and without giving any consideration to the right to equality enshrined in our Constitution. 

    Learned President Counsel for the 1st respondent Bank contended that all employees in Grade 3 - II including the petitioners were to sit for the examination in terms of Staff Circular No. 300/99(P1) and the new Management Trainees (5th to 51st respondents) were also allowed to sit for the said examination. In terms of Staff Circular No. 300/99 (P1) the applicants for the position of Manager Grade  3 - I had to sit for an examination and the eligibility criteria for this purpose made it a compulsory requirement that the officers should have completed a minimum of 3 years of service in the Grade of Deputy Manager (Grade 3 - II). As has been stated earlier the 5th to 51st respondents joined the Bank only in February 2002 as Management Trainees and they were not qualified to sit for the aforementioned examination at that time in terms of the provisions of Staff Circular No. 300/99(P1 ).

    Learned President's Counsel for the 1st respondent Bank correctly submitted that the 1st respondent Bank as an employer has a right to change its recruitment procedure and policies from time to time and correct and/or remedy mistakes of the existing schemes in the best  interests of the Bank. Whilst endorsing the views expressed by the learned President's Counsel, it has to be stated that although the Bank has the right to take necessary and appropriate action for the development of the Bank, such action must be taken having in mind the provisions of the Constitution, especially giving due consideration to the equality provision contained in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. 

    When this matter was supported for leave to proceed, learned President's Cousel for the respondents had given an undertaking that the decision of the 1st respondent Bank to appoint the 5th to 51st respondents to Grade 3 - I would be suspended until the final hearing and determination of this application. Therefore the 5th to 51 respondents were not appointed to Grade 3 - I.

    Considering the totality of the circumstances of this application it is evident that by promoting the 5th to 51st respondents from the position of Management Trainee to Manager Grade 3 - I, the 1st respondent Bank had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably and therefore, I hold that the 1st respondent Bank had violated the petitioners' fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. For the reasons aforementioned, therefore the appointments made to Grade 3 -I from and among the 5th to 51st respondents must be set aside. The 1st and 2nd respondents are directed to take steps afresh for granting promotions to the rank of Manager Grade 3 - I, according to law.

I make no order as to costs.

**WEERASURIYA,J.** -I agree.

**DISSANAYAKE,J**.-I agree.

Relief granted.
