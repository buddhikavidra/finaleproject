Bail-Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997, section 3(1) - Poisons, Opium and Dangerous
Drugs Act, No. 12 of 1952, section 83(1) - Does section 3(1) of the Bail Act
exclude the application of section 83(1) of Act, No.12 of 1952 as amended by
Act, No. 13 of 1984? -Is section 83(1) a provision referred to in the
expression "any other written law in respect of the release on bail of persons
accused under such other written law" contained in section 3(1) of the Bail
Act or cover offences eusdem generis contained in the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 and regulations made under the
Public Security Ordinance? \- Jurisdiction of High Court to consider bail
under section 83(1) of Act, No. 12 of 1952 as amended - Use of proceedings of
Parliament in construing legislative intention.

    The appellant, his wife and driver were charged with possession of 9.086kg of heroin. The Magistrate made order for the remand of the three suspects in  view of the fact that under section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, No.12 of 1952 as amended by Act, No.13 of 1984, no person suspected of an offence under Section 54 of that Act shall be released on bail except by the High Court in exceptional circumstances. The High Court in applications by the appellant and his wife released the wife but not the appellant. The appellant's revision application was dismissed by the Court of Appeal for want of exceptional circumstances. 

    It was argued for the appellant that section 3( 1) of the Bail Act nullified the remand in that while section 2 provided that giving bail was the rule and refusal

was the exception, under section 3(1) of that Act it is provided that nothing
in  
this Act shall apply to a person who is accused or suspected or convicted  
under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979  
or under regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance or any other  
written Law which makes express provision in respect of bail of persons  
accused or suspected or convicted of offences under such other written law. It  
was argued that the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act was not a  
written Law eusdem generis the laws mentioned in section 3(1) of the Bail Act  
which excluded laws relating to public order. Hence section 3(1) had no effect  
on persons accused of offences under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous  
Drugs Act which deals with a different subject.

**HELD:**

1\. The eusdem generis rule had no application and section 3(1) permitted the
prohibition under section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act
against bail. As such, the section 83 restriction against bail was operating
despite section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

2\. In case of doubt, it is competent to look at Parliamentary debates on Acts
to ascertain the intention of the law. According to recent judgments the
debate in Parliament on the Bail Act shows that bail under that Act was not
available to a person accused of an offence under written law in the nature of
section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act restricting bail and
not necessarily limited to written laws dealing with public order.

**SHIRANI BANDARANAYAKE, J.**

    This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 15.02.2005. By that judgment the Court of Appeal refused the application made in Revision by the 1st suspect - petitioner- appellant hereinafter referred to as the appellant) for bail pending trial in the High Court of Colombo. The appellant made an application to this Court on which special leave to appeal was granted on the following question: 

"Did the Court of Appeal err in law by the failure to take into account the
provisions of the Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997".

    The facts of this appeal, as submitted by the appellant, albeit/brief, are as follows:

    The appellant, a 46 years old businessman, was arrested along with his wife and his driver on 28.11.2003 at his residence. It was alleged that the appellant was in possession of 23kg of brown powder (pure quantity of heroin was 9.086kg as confirmed by the Government Analyst). ) On 29.11.2003 the three suspects were produced before the learned magistrate, Maligakanda where order was made detaining them until 05.12.2003. On 05.12.2003 the learned Magistrate made order remanding the three suspects and the appellant submitted that he had been in remand since then (P1 ). On 10.02.2004 the appellant, his wife and the driver had made applications for bail to the High Court of Colombo (P1, P3 and P4). The bail applications in respect of the appellant and his wife were taken together for inquiry before the High Court of Colombo and by his order delivered on 12.03.2004, the learned High Court Judge allowed the application made by the appellant wife and granted her bail, but had refused his application (P7). The appellant, being aggrieved by that order filed an application in Revision in the Court of Appeal which was dismissed on 15.02.2005 for the reason that the documentation produced on his behalf in support of his application for bail do not reveal any exceptional circumstances and that for the ailments  the appellant has complained of, treatment could be obtained from the Prison Hospital.

    Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant had been indicted before the High Court of Colombo in terms of the provisions of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, No. 12of 1952as amended by Act, No. 13 of 1984for possession and trafficking of heroin. The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant is that the grant of bail in respect of suspects who are charged under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended, is subject to the provisions of the Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997(hereinafterreferredto as the Bail Act) and that the provisions of the Bail Act would apply to any person accused or suspected of having committed or convicted of offences under any law other than those who are accused or suspected of having committed or convicted under the Public Security Ordinance, Prevention of Terrorism Act and any other written law which makes express provision in regard to the release of such suspect on bail. It was also contended that the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act as amended cannot come within the ambit of any other written law as contemplated by section 3(1) of the Bail Act as there is no provision in the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act with regard to the release of suspects accused of or having. committed offences under the said Act. Learned President's Counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to section 2 of the Bail Act. According to the learned President's Counsel for the appellant, section 2 of the Bail Act contemplates that the grant of bail shall be regarded as the rule and the refusal to grant bail as the exception. 

    It is common ground that since the enactment of the Bail Act, it is the general law which is applicable for the granting of bail as it replaced the relevant provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. However, the Bail Act had excluded special statutes which had made express provisions pertaining to the grant of bail and such provisions are contained in section 3(1) of the Bail Act, which reads as follows: 

    "Nothing in this Act shall apply to any person accused or suspected of having committed, or convicted of, an offence under, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No.48 of 1979, Regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance or any other written law which makes express provision in respect of the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of having committed, or convicted of, offences under such other written law (emphasis added.)"

    Admittedly the appellant has been indicted under the provisions of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, No. 12 of 1952 (as amended by Act No. 13of 1984)and was charged for possession and trafficking in a total of 9.086Kg. of heroin. The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant was that section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium arid Dangerous Drugs Act introduced by the amending Act, No. 13 of 1984, provides that no person suspected of an offence under section54A shall be released on bail except by the High Court in exceptional circumstances. Learned President's Counsel thus submitted that the appellant was indicted with the commission of offences under section54A of the Act and if not for the Bail Act, would come within the provisions of section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act. Therefore it was contended on behalf of the appellant that both the High Court and the Court of Appeal erred in not taking cognizance of the fact that provisions of the Bail Act prevailed over the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, considering the operation of the ejusdem generis rule in the construction of section 3(1) of the Bail Act. Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent strenuously argued that the ejusdem generis rule has no application to section 3(1) and therefore the appellant cannot come within the provisions of section  3(1) of th Bail Act. Since the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant is chiefly based on the applicability of the rule of ejusdem generis in interpreting section 3(1) of the Bail Act, it would be necessary to examine the said rule vis a vis its application to section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

    Ejusdem generis, as stated in Bangolore Electric Supply Co. Ltd, v. CIT, West Bengal (1)is not a rule of law, but a rule of construction, which would enable a Court to ascertain the intention of the legislature. The rule is applicable only when particular words, which belong to a class, category or genus, are followed by general words. Referring to this doctrine, Bindra (Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, pgs. 684-685) clearly states that, the rule "requires to be applied with great caution and not pushed too far so as to unduly or unnecessarily limit general and comprehensive words  
to dwarf size. He further stated that,

"The rule of ejusdem generis is not one of universal application. It is merely
a rule of construction and as such it may be of no assistance when the
intention of the legislature is so plain as to require no resort to cannons of
construction.,

The rule is to be made use of only where the language of the statute under
consideration is somewhat vague or uncertain. The rule of ejusdern generis is
applicable when particular words pertaining to a class, category or genus are
followed by general words. In such a case the general words are constructed as
limited to things of the same kind as those specified. The rule applies only
when;

(a) the statute enumerates the specific words;  
(b) the subjects of enumeration constitute a class or category ;  
(c) that class or category is not exhausted by the enumeration;  
(d) the general terms following the enumeration; and  
(e) there is no indication of a different legislative intent."

    Section 3(1) of the Bail Act, which has been referred to earlier, stipulates specifically that nothing in the Bail Act shall apply to any person accused or suspected of having committed or convicted of an offence under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 and the Regulations made undE,3r the Public Security Ordinance. 

    This section thereafter refers to 'any other written law, which makes express provision' in respect of the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of having committed, or convicted of offences under such other written law. Accordingly, it is evident that it refers to two specific laws, viz, the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Regulations made under the Public Security Ordinance and to any other written law, which have made express provision in respect of the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of having committed or convicted of offences under those specific laws.

    Learned President's Counsel for the appellant contended that the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Public Security Ordinance are of the same genus or species as they relate to the security of the State and the public and therefore 'any other written law' is to apply to those cases within the genus of which the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Public Security Ordinance are instances.

    However, as referred to by Craies (Statute Law, 7th Edition, pg. 181) to invoke the application of the ejusdem generis rule there must be a distinct genus or category. In the words of Craies (supra),

"The modern tendency of the law, it was said, is to attenuate the application
of the rule of ejusdem generis".

    The rule of ejusdem generis is based on the theory that "where general words follow particular and specific words of the same nature, the general words must be confined to the things of the same kind as those specified" (Bindra (supra) at pg. 686) However, as has been already decided Koehuni v State of Madras and Kerala (2)Melieio Fernandes v Mohan Nair (3)it is essential that the specific words must form a distinct genus or a category. In the event there is no such formation of a genus or category there is no possibility for the ejusdem generis rule to be applied. Referring to the application of the ejusdem generis rule, Francis Bennion opined that for the said purpose there must be a sufficient indication of a category that can properly be described as a class or genus, although not specified as such in the enactment. In SS Magnhild (owners) v. Me Intyre Brothers and CO.(4)Mc Cardie, J. said that,

"So far as I can see the only test seems to be whether the specified things
which precede the general words can be placed under some common category. By
this I understand that the specified things must possess some common and
dominant feature."

    Considering the provisions of section 3(1) of the Bail Act, it is clear that reference is made first to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Public Security Ordinance, followed by a general statement, which states that the provisions of the Bail Act shall not apply in respect of offences committed under certain laws. The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant was that ex facie the Prevention of Terrorism Act and Public Security Ordinance, referred to in section 3(1) of  the Bail Act, clearly constitutes a genus, viz., laws relating to the security of the State and as such the phrase "any other written law' must be construed ejusdem generis as contemplating only laws of the same genus. 

    On a careful consideration of section 3(1) of the Bail Act, a question arises as to whether it would be correct to say that the term 'any other' in Section 3(1) of the Bail Act would clearly constitute a genus to include the third limb of the section to follow the two statutes referred to in the first two limbs of that section, and I would now turn to examine the said question. 

    The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Public Security Ordinance, not only relate to laws containing offences pertaining to the security of the State, but also makes express provision that relates to bail. Therefore they belong to a narrow genus of security of the State and to a broad genus of laws containing provisions relating to the grant of bail. Referring to the application of ejusdem generis principle in a situation where there is a narrow genus as well as a broad genus, Bindra (supra pg. 685) states that,

"if the preceding words do not constitute mere specifications of a genus, but
constitute description of a complete genus, the rule has no application. If
the subjects of enumeration belong to a broad based genus, as also to a
narrower genus there is no principle that the general words should be confined
to the narrower genus (emphasis added.)"

    It is therefore quite clear that in terms of section 3(1) of the Bail Act, if there is any other written law which contains express provision for the grant of bail to persons suspected or accused or convicted of offences such enactment would be excluded from the applicability of the Bail Act. 

    The 'common feature' therefore in section 3(1) of the Bail Act is the exclusion from the application of the Bail Act wherever express provision has been made for the grant of bail to persons accused or suspected or convicted of offences under the specific law.

    A general reading of section 3(1) clearly specifies that the Bail Act shall not apply in certain instances and the criterion that should be applied to ascertain the applicability of the Bail Act therefore is to find out whether the law in question contains express provision for the grant of bail to persons accused or suspected or convicted of offences under the said Law.

    On an application of the tests for the purpose of deciding whether the ejusdem generis rule should apply, it is thus evident that the general words of the third limb of section 3(1) of the Bail Act takes a meaning beyond the genus, if any, created by the first and second limbs of that section. In fact it  is the general words in the third limb, which form the category for exclusion and to apply the rule of ejusdem generis in this case would render the general words contained in the third limb of section 3(1) of the Bail Act meaningless for the reason that there is nothing ejusdem generis to fall within the purview of the said third limb. Further, if such an interpretation is given, it could contravene the more important rule of construction, viz., 'that all words are to be given effect'. Therefore, the answer to the question as to whether the rule of ejusdem generis would be applicable in interpreting section 3(1) of the Bail Act is clearly in the negative. The contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant that the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act is subject to the provisions of the Bail Act also fails for other reasons stated in the succeeding paragraphs, which clearly illustrates that the provisions of section 3(1) of the Bail Act shall not apply in respect of offences committed under certain laws.

    The applicability of section 3(1) of the Bail Act was referred to by Mark Fernando, J. in S. C. (SO) Nos. 6 and 7 of 1998, which considered the Bill titled 'An Act to Eliminate Ragging and Other Forms of Violence and Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment from Educational Institutions." Section 10 of the Bill contained provisions restricting the right to release a person suspected or accused of committing an offence under sub-section (2) of section 2 or section 4 of the Bill and considering this section, Mark Fernando, J., observed that (supra pg. 30): 

    "The Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997, is of some relevance. It recognizes that the grant of bail shall be the rule, and the refusal to grant bail the exception, subject to the exceptions specified in the Act. One exception is that the Act shall not apply to any person accused or suspected of offences under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979, Emergency Regulations and any other written law which makes express provision in respect of the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of offences under such written law. If Section 10 is valid, then this Bill, when enacted, would be one those exceptions (emphasis added)."

    Thus, Justice Mark Fernando had recognized section 3(1) of the Bail Act as a provision which excludes 'any other written law which makes express provision for the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of offences under that written law.' This position could be further clarified by an examination of the parliamentary proceedings pertaining to the Bail Bill.

    Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents contended that the parliamentary proceedings could be used by the Court to ascertain the intention of the legislature. 

    Until the land mark decision in Pepper v Hart (5)the rule followed by the English judges had been that parliamentary debates reported in Hansard could not be referred to in order to facilitate the interpretation of a statute. However, by the decision in Pepper v Hart (supra), a new practice came into being relaxing the exclusionary rule and permitting reference to parliamentary material, Referring to this new approach, Lord Griffiths in Pepper v Hart (supra) stated that,

"The Courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks to give effect to the
true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous
material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was
enacted."

    In Sri Lanka, the Courts were reluctant to consider the proceedings in the Parliament for the purpose of interpretation. However, the attitude of our Courts took a new turn tilting towards a purposive approach in J. B. Textiles Industries Ltd. v Minister of Finance and Planning(6)where Samarakoon, C. J., expressed the view that,

"Hansards are admissible to prove that course of proceedings in the
legislature." .

    Since the decision in J. B. Textile Industries Ltd., (supra), our Courts had acted with approval the acceptability in perusing the Hansard for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the Parliament Manawadu v Attorney General (7).In fact in De Silva and Others v Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and Others(8)Mark Fernando, J. adopted the observations of Samarakoon,C. J. in L? Textiles Industries Ltd., case (supra) which stated as follows: 

"The Hansard is the official publication of Parliament. It is published to
keep the public informed of what takes place in Parliament. It is neither
sacrosanct nor untouchable."

    It is therefore apparent that the Court which now adopts a purposive approach, could refer to the Hansard for the purpose of ascertaining the intention and the true purpose of the legislature in order to interpret the legislation which is ambiguous, obscure or leading to an absurdity.

    The speech made by the then Hon. Minister of Justice, Prof. G. L. Peiris at the introduction of the Bail Act, would thus be important in the interpretation of section 3(1) of the Bail Act.

    The Bail Act, as has been stated in its long title, was introduced to provide for the release on bail or persons suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or having committed an offence and to provide for the granting of anticipatory bail. Section 2 of the said Act saw a clean departure from the earlier provisions in granting bail which stated that  subject to the exceptions that has been provided for in the Act, the guiding principle in the implementation of the provisions of the Bail Act shall be that the grant of bail be regarded as the rule and the refusal to grant bail as the exception. Section 2 of the Bail Act therefore not only provides for the guiding principle in the implementation of the Act, but also clearly states that there would be exceptions to the said guiding principle. This position was clearly emphasized by the then Minister of Justice, when he moved the Bail Bill at the Second Reading in Parliament where he stated that (Government Hansard of 07.10.1997 at pgs. 504- 05).

"It has been necessary to exclude certain statutory regimes from the ambit of
application of this law. The Bill which I have the honour to present does not
apply to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

          Offence sunder the Prevention of Terrorism Act are not caught up within the ambit of this law because there are special considerations applicable to the safety of the State... 

For the same reasons, Mr.Speaker, regulations under the Public Security
Ordinance will also not be regulated by the provisions contained in this new
piece of legislation nor will this legislation apply to other written laws,
which contain express provisions in respect of bail for persons accused of
offences under such laws (emphasis added.)"

    As stated earlier the guiding principle in the implementation of the provisions of the Bail Act was that the grant of bail be regarded as a rule and the refusal to grant bail was the exception. However, when one considers the intention of the Parliament in introducing the Bail Act, it is  observed that this Act would not apply to other written laws which contain express provisions in respect of bail for  persons accused of offences under such laws. This statement thus encompasses the laws which makes specific provision relating to bail for persons accused of offences imperative of the fact whether such laws relate to the public security of the country. T he intention of the legislature that there should be situations where bail could be refused is also clear by the statement that stated the principal reasons for the refusal of bail. Referring to such refusal, the then Hon. Minister of Justice, Prof. G. L. Peiris stated that,

"Mr. Speaker, there are only four principal reasons for the refusal of bail
The fact of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, is that the person concerned will not
appear to stand trial. In other words, he will abscond, he will be a fugitive
from justice. In that situation, obviously, you cannot grant bail. The second
reason is interference with witness or obstruction of the course of justice
that will frustrate the objectives of a fair, impartial and objective
trial..."

    Therefore, the framers of the Bail Act, while considering the individual liberty of any accused person had also given their mind to the need for the collective security of the community. Accordingly, on the basis of considering the collective security of the community, the exception to the rule had been stated and by section 3(1), such exception had been laid down, which includes not only the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the  Public Security Ordinance, but also the other written laws which contain express provisions in respect of bail for persons accused, or suspected of having committed or convicted of offences under those laws. Thus the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, also would come within the purview, 'of any other written law' stated in section 3(1) of the Bail Act and therefore the provisions of the Bail Act would have no application to the said Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

    There is one other matter that I have to consider before I part with this judgment.

    Learned President's Counsel contended that the Bail Act super cedes Section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act when considered in the light of Section 3(1) of the Bail Act and therefore in such instances the provisions of the Bail Act should prevail.

    Section83(1)of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, NO.13of 1984 makes express provision in respect of the release of persons accused or suspected of having committed offences under such other written law, on bail and states as follows:-

"No person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54A or 54B of this
Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the High Court in exceptional
circumstances."

    It is thus clearly seen that, in terms of section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, the High Court, in exceptional circumstances, could grant bail to a person who is suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or 54B of the said Act. Section 3(1) of the Bail Act, on the other hand clearly provides that, when there is express provision under written law in respect of the release on bail of persons accused or suspected of having committed or convicted then the provisions of the Bail Act shall not apply to such persons coming under the relevant written law. If, according to the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the appellant, the provisions of the Bail Act should super cede section 83 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act, then the provisions of section 3(1) should prevail, which clearly states that the provisions expressed in the relevant statute should apply. Therefore, even if I am to agree with the submissions of the learned President's Counsel for the appellants, yet the provisions of section 83( 1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act would be applicable and the proper forum for making an application for bail when a person is suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or 54B of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act would be the High Court where such bail would be granted only in exceptional circumstances. The criteria therefore set out by section 3( 1) of the Bail Act for exclusions are clearly dealt with by the provisions contained in section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 1984. 

    Accordingly, I answer the question on which special leave to appeal was granted in the negative and for the aforementioned reasons, I hold that the provisions in the Bail Act would have no application to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act. The judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 15.02.2005 is therefore affirmed. This appeal is accordingly dismissed, but in all the circumstances of this case, I make no order as to costs.

**WEERASURIYA, J.** -I agree.
